# The Pivot Podcast - Drug Repurposing Stories

Welcome to **The Pivot Podcast**, a deep-dive into the fascinating history and business of drug
repurposing—when medicines fail at their original purpose but find massive success treating
something completely different.

## About This Project

**Repurposing Stories** is a podcast and research project that explores:

-   🔬 **The Science**: How did scientists discover unexpected mechanisms of action?
