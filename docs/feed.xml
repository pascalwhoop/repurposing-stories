        <title>The Pivot - Drug Repurposing Stories</title>
        <link>https://pascalwhoop.github.io/repurposing-stories</link>
        <description>The Pivot analyzes the business and science of repurposed drugs, modeled after the structure of the Acquired podcast. Each episode deep-dives into a drug that failed at its original purpose but found massive success in treating a completely different condition.</description>

            <description><![CDATA[In 1997, the FDA approved rituximab to kill cancerous B cells in lymphoma patients—it would become one of the best-selling drugs in history, generating over $100 billion in revenue. But within a decade, this cancer drug would accidentally overturn 50 years of scientific consensus about multiple sclerosis, revealing that neurologists had been targeting the wrong immune cells all along. The result: a paradigm shift that transformed MS from a disease of inevitable disability into a manageable condition, giving hundreds of thousands of patients something they'd never had before—hope for a life without relapses. This is the story of how a single 2008 trial showing 91% reduction in MRI lesions stunned the neurology world, spawned a $9 billion annual market, and became the first treatment ever for primary progressive MS.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In the late 1950s, Upjohn chemists were hunting for an ulcer cure when they accidentally stumbled upon a blood pressure drug that caused one embarrassing side effect: patients sprouted hair everywhere, like werewolves on medication. Deemed a cosmetic nightmare that caused women to stop their lifesaving hypertension treatment, this "flaw" nearly ended the drug's commercial viability—until a cardiologist's casual consultation with a Miami dermatologist transformed it into the world's first FDA-approved hair loss treatment. What followed was a 15-year patent war, a $200 million blockbuster, and a cultural revolution that legitimized an entire industry of appearance medicine—all because someone paid attention when patients started getting hairy.]]></description>
