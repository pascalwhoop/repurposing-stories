    "description": "In the late 1950s, Upjohn chemists were hunting for an ulcer cure when they accidentally stumbled upon a blood pressure drug that caused one embarrassing side effect: patients sprouted hair everywhere, like werewolves on medication. Deemed a cosmetic nightmare that caused women to stop their lifesaving hypertension treatment, this \"flaw\" nearly ended the drug's commercial viability—until a cardiologist's casual consultation with a Miami dermatologist transformed it into the world's first FDA-approved hair loss treatment. What followed was a 15-year patent war, a $200 million blockbuster, and a cultural revolution that legitimized an entire industry of appearance medicine—all because someone paid attention when patients started getting hairy.",
