# Chapter 1: "The Wrong Target" (1958-1971)

ELENA: [energetic] Alright, let's set the scene. Late 1950s, Kalamazoo, Michigan. The Upjohn Company - and we're talking about a serious pharmaceutical giant founded back in 1886 - is on the hunt for new drugs. And their target is ulcers.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] They ordered this compound called N,N-diallylmelamine from a chemical catalog. DAM for short. The plan was to test it as an anticholinergic medication for gastric acid.

ELENA: [playful] Wait, they just ordered it from a catalog? Like Amazon for chemists?

MARCUS: [amused] Basically, yes. And they tested it in dogs. The goal was ulcer treatment, but it completely failed to produce the anticholinergic effects they wanted.

ELENA: [intrigued] But something else happened, right?

MARCUS: [fascinated] This is where observational science kicks in. The dogs showed prolonged reduction in blood pressure. Now, when they tried this in humans, DAM didn't replicate the effect. But they'd seen something interesting enough to pursue.

ELENA: [excited] So what's a serious pharma company do when they see a glimmer of potential?

MARCUS: [impressed] They go big. Early 1960s, Upjohn chemists synthesized over 200 variations of this compound. We're talking systematic testing for vasodilator properties - drugs that widen blood vessels to lower blood pressure.

ELENA: [amazed] Two hundred variations! Okay, I need context. What was Upjohn's financial situation? Were they desperate, or was this just standard R&D?

MARCUS: [curious] That's a great question. What did you find?

ELENA: [enthusiastic] So Upjohn in the early 1960s was actually in pretty solid shape. They were known for quality pharmaceutical research, had multiple successful drugs on the market. This wasn't desperation - this was what big pharma did back then. You had the resources, you did the science.

MARCUS: [delighted] And in 1963, they land on the winner. Chemical formula: 2,4-diamino-6-piperidinopyrimidine 3-oxide. They called it minoxidil. That piperidine ring structure turned out to be absolutely key to its activity.

ELENA: [skeptical] Okay, science time. How does this thing actually work? Because I know it's wild.

MARCUS: [passionate] Oh, this is where it gets elegant. Minoxidil is a direct-acting peripheral arterial vasodilator. It acts on vascular smooth muscle by opening ATP-sensitive potassium channels.

ELENA: [playful] Hold up. Pretend I'm the audience and explain potassium channels like I'm five.

MARCUS: [animated] Perfect. So imagine the cells in your blood vessel walls have tiny gates that control what flows in and out. Potassium channels are gates specifically for potassium ions. When minoxidil opens these gates, potassium rushes out of the smooth muscle cells.

ELENA: [following] Okay, potassium flows out. Then what?

MARCUS: [excited] This makes the cell membrane more negatively charged - that's hyperpolarization. And when that happens, calcium can't get into the cell as easily. Calcium is what makes muscles contract. Less calcium equals relaxed muscles, which means dilated blood vessels, which means lower blood pressure.

ELENA: [impressed] That's actually beautiful. But I'm guessing there's a "but" coming?

MARCUS: [serious] Oh, there's a big "but." Because when you suddenly drop someone's blood pressure, their body absolutely panics.

ELENA: [intrigued] What kind of panic are we talking about?

MARCUS: [analytical] Two major compensatory mechanisms. First, reflex tachycardia. Your baroreceptors detect the blood pressure drop and activate the sympathetic nervous system. Heart rate shoots up, cardiac output increases - your body is desperately trying to restore blood pressure.

ELENA: [concerned] So the drug lowers your blood pressure but makes your heart race? That sounds like a problem if you have heart disease.

MARCUS: [grave] It can trigger angina in cardiac patients. And here's the second problem - fluid retention. The blood pressure drop activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

ELENA: [interrupting] RAAS, right? I've heard about this.

MARCUS: [pleased] Exactly. Your kidneys start retaining sodium and water. Patients gain 5 to 10 pounds, sometimes more. Swollen ankles, swollen legs. Some even develop pericardial effusion - fluid around the heart.

ELENA: [intense] Okay, so walk me through what this means practically. If I'm a doctor in 1970 and I want to prescribe this drug, what am I dealing with?

MARCUS: [methodical] You cannot use minoxidil alone. It requires triple therapy: minoxidil to lower blood pressure, a beta-blocker like propranolol to control the heart rate, and a diuretic like furosemide to prevent the fluid retention.

ELENA: [thoughtful] Three medications, careful monitoring, complex titration. This is not a simple pill you take in the morning. This is for serious cases only.

MARCUS: [affirming] Exactly. Which meant it could only be justified for severe, refractory hypertension - patients who had failed everything else and whose blood pressure was dangerously high.

ELENA: [curious] So Upjohn needs clinical trials. Where do they go?

MARCUS: [professional] They approached academic medical centers. And this is where our key figure enters: Dr. Charles A. Chidsey the Third, Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. Cardiovascular medicine and clinical pharmacology expert.

ELENA: [energized] And this is early 1970s, right? What was the competitive landscape for hypertension drugs back then?

MARCUS: [inviting] You tell me. What did you find about the treatment options at that time?

ELENA: [enthusiastic] Okay, so by the early 1970s, first-line treatments were diuretics like thiazides, beta-blockers like propranolol, methyldopa, reserpine. For severe cases, they had hydralazine - which was in the same class as minoxidil, a vasodilator - and guanethidine, which was powerful but had brutal side effects.

MARCUS: [nodding] And the problem was that many patients with severe hypertension were refractory to these conventional medications. There was a real need for more potent options.

ELENA: [intense] Because severe hypertension leads to malignant hypertension, stroke, kidney failure, heart failure. This is life or death.

MARCUS: [grave] Exactly. So Chidsey conducts his first clinical trial with minoxidil in combination with beta-blockers and diuretics. The results show effective blood pressure reduction. It's working.

ELENA: [leaning in] But it's the second study where things get weird.

MARCUS: [dramatically] Early 1971. Chidsey is monitoring his patients in the second trial, and he starts noticing something completely bizarre. They're growing hair. Everywhere.

ELENA: [shocked] Wait, define "everywhere."

MARCUS: [detailed] Dark hair appearing on foreheads - people started calling it the "werewolf" appearance. Eyebrows thickening dramatically. Hair growing on backs, shoulders, arms. For women, facial hair.

ELENA: [stunned] Hold on. What was the incidence? Like, a couple of patients, or...?

MARCUS: [emphatic] Eighty to one hundred percent of patients. It was universal. Started three to six weeks after beginning treatment. Fine, downy hair at first, then darker and coarser.

ELENA: [processing] Okay, so I need to pause here because this is the irony of ironies. These patients have severe, life-threatening hypertension. Their blood pressure is out of control and nothing else is working. And some of them stopped taking the medication?

MARCUS: [soberly] Particularly women. There are published papers from this era titled "Rebound Hypertension Following Minoxidil Withdrawal." Patients would stop taking it - often citing the cosmetic side effects - and their blood pressure would surge dangerously.

ELENA: [disbelieving] They're choosing how they look over preventing a stroke or heart attack. That tells you everything about how disturbing this side effect must have been.

MARCUS: [reflective] It does. And Chidsey is puzzled. A blood pressure medication causing hair growth made no obvious mechanistic sense. Vasodilators didn't typically do this.

ELENA: [intrigued] So what's going through his head? Is he thinking "annoying side effect, let's note it and move on," or is something else clicking?

MARCUS: [appreciative] This is the critical moment, and it speaks to Chidsey's scientific curiosity. He could have dismissed it. Instead, he decided to consult someone who might understand what was happening.

ELENA: [triumphant] He called a dermatologist!

MARCUS: [confirming] Dr. Guinter Kahn, running the dermatology department at the University of Miami. But before we get to that phone call, we need to understand the landscape Kahn would have been seeing.

ELENA: [settling in] Right. Because context is everything. Let me paint this picture for you. It's 1971, and if you're a man losing your hair, what are your options?

MARCUS: [inviting] Tell me.

ELENA: [cataloging] Option one: hair transplants. But we're talking crude 1950s and 60s technology. They're taking plugs with 10 to 20 hair follicles and planting them in your scalp. The result? A "corn row" appearance that people compared to doll hair. Expensive, painful, and it looked terrible.

MARCUS: [adding] By the 70s and early 80s, mini-grafts and micro-grafts were improving results, but it was still considered drastic.

ELENA: [continuing] Option two: toupees and hairpieces. Heavily advertised, massive social stigma, often obvious. The old "rug" jokes. Option three - and this is wild - scalp reduction surgery.

MARCUS: [grimacing] Surgically removing bald scalp and stretching the remaining hair-bearing scalp over it.

ELENA: [cringing] Significant scarring, limited adoption, and honestly sounds medieval. Option four: accept it. Shave your head, embrace baldness. This was actually the most common approach.

MARCUS: [supplementing] And then there were the snake oil remedies. Countless unproven lotions, potions, special shampoos. Heavy advertising, no FDA oversight for cosmetic products, no scientific basis. But men bought them anyway.

ELENA: [emphasizing] Because there were zero FDA-approved treatments. Zero proven topical medications. Zero systemic medications - finasteride wouldn't be approved until 1997. And no real scientific understanding of what causes androgenetic alopecia.

MARCUS: [solemnly] For women, it was even worse. Female pattern hair loss was rarely acknowledged, considered more socially devastating than male baldness, but virtually no treatment options. The medical establishment paid little attention.

ELENA: [animated] And culturally - Marcus, this is important - we're heading into the 1980s. The era of big hair! Voluminous teased hair, rock bands with massive manes, soap opera stars. Hair loss is becoming even more psychologically devastating against this cultural backdrop.

MARCUS: [connecting] So when you're a dermatologist in 1971 and you get a call from a cardiologist saying "I have patients growing hair on a blood pressure medication," what's going through your mind?

ELENA: [excited] You're thinking about 50 million men in the U.S. with male pattern baldness and zero legitimate medical treatments. You're seeing dollar signs, but you're also seeing a genuine opportunity to help people with a condition that has no real solution.

MARCUS: [transitioning] But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Before that phone call happens, minoxidil still has to prove itself as a hypertension drug.

ELENA: [curious] Right, so Upjohn submits for FDA approval?

MARCUS: [confirming] 1979. Brand name: Loniten. Oral tablets for severe hypertension. But the approval came with very strict restrictions.

ELENA: [reading] "Reserved for severe, symptomatic hypertension in patients refractory to maximum tolerated doses of a diuretic plus two other antihypertensive agents."

MARCUS: [clarifying] It's literally the drug of last resort. And the label was explicit about the side effects. Hypertrichosis in 80 to 100 percent of patients, described as cosmetically disturbing, especially for women, but reversible upon discontinuation.

ELENA: [laughing darkly] Reversible upon discontinuation - except you can't discontinue because you need it for your blood pressure. That's quite a bind.

MARCUS: [acknowledging] It is. But the efficacy data was solid. Clinical trials showed it could control blood pressure in 72 to 85 percent of refractory patients. For people who had failed everything else, this was potentially lifesaving.

ELENA: [shifting] Okay, but I want to talk about what's happening to Upjohn in the early 1980s. Because the business context matters for understanding why they eventually embraced the hair loss opportunity.

MARCUS: [interested] What did you find?

ELENA: [reporting] By the mid-1980s, Upjohn is facing patent cliffs on multiple major drugs. Their stock price is under pressure. They need new revenue sources. And minoxidil for hypertension is not going to be that source.

MARCUS: [adding] Especially because the competition is arriving. 1981, captopril - the first ACE inhibitor - gets approved. This completely transforms hypertension management.

ELENA: [enthusiastic] And ACE inhibitors are better in almost every way, right? Effective, better tolerated, no cosmetic side effects, can be used earlier in the treatment algorithm.

MARCUS: [confirming] Enalapril followed in 1985. Then calcium channel blockers like nifedipine and diltiazem went mainstream. By the mid-1980s, minoxidil had fallen to the bottom of the treatment algorithm.

ELENA: [synthesizing] So let me make sure I have the timeline straight. 1971, Chidsey observes the hair growth. 1979, FDA approves Loniten for hypertension. Early 1980s, better hypertension drugs arrive and squeeze minoxidil out. And Upjohn is looking at a drug that works but has terrible side effects and a tiny market.

MARCUS: [affirming] Exactly. It's reserved for specialists - nephrologists, cardiologists. Primary care physicians rarely prescribe it. It's clinically useful but commercially disappointing.

ELENA: [reflective] Which means that phone call Chidsey made back in 1971 - the one to the dermatologist in Miami - is starting to look a lot more important for Upjohn's future.

MARCUS: [agreeing] That phone call changed everything. But in 1971, nobody knew that yet. The defect hadn't become a feature.

ELENA: [playful] The defect hadn't become a feature - I love that. Shall we take a break before we dive into what happens when Chidsey and Kahn connect?

MARCUS: [warmly] Yeah, let's do it. I need to process the fact that we're talking about a drug that people stopped taking to save their lives because it made them hairy, and that same side effect is about to make it a blockbuster.

ELENA: [laughing] The irony is absolutely chef's kiss.
