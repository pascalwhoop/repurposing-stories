# Chapter 2: "The Phone Call That Changed Everything" (1971)

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Okay, so we're back in early 1971. Dr. Charles Chidsey at the University of Colorado has just observed this bizarre side effect in his second minoxidil trial. Patients are growing hair everywhere.

ELENA: [excited] And he picks up the phone and calls Miami. This is the moment, right? This is where everything changes. He calls Dr. Guinter Kahn at the University of Miami.

MARCUS: [intrigued] So what do we know about Kahn?

ELENA: [energetic] Okay, so Kahn was fascinating. He was a dermatology resident at Miami when he first observed and reported hair development on patients using the drug. He had expertise in hair disorders, research interest in hair growth. But here's what I found most interesting about Kahn - he wasn't just an academic. The guy had serious entrepreneurial instincts. And that changes everything about how this story unfolds.

MARCUS: [fascinated] So when Chidsey tells him about the side effect, what does Kahn see?

ELENA: [intense] Opportunity. Massive, billion-dollar opportunity. Think about it - 50 plus million men in the U.S. alone with male pattern baldness. Zero FDA-approved treatments. Zero! Men are buying snake oil, doing combover gymnastics, suffering in silence. And here's a drug that's causing hair growth in essentially 100 percent of patients.

MARCUS: [serious] But there's a fundamental problem. Oral minoxidil causes systemic hair growth everywhere - your back, your arms, your face - plus all those cardiovascular side effects we talked about. You can't just tell bald men to take a hypertension medication and cross your fingers.

ELENA: [thoughtful] So Kahn has to solve a delivery problem. The drug works, but the delivery mechanism is wrong.

MARCUS: [passionate] Exactly! So his hypothesis is elegant: what if you could apply it topically, just to the scalp? Deliver the drug directly to the hair follicles without systemic absorption. Avoid all the side effects. Target only where you want hair.

ELENA: [curious] But that's easier said than done, right? You can't just crush up pills and rub them on your head.

MARCUS: [excited] No! This is where the pharmaceutical science gets really interesting. Kahn needs to create a vehicle - a formulation that can carry minoxidil through the skin barrier, keep it stable, deliver it to the hair follicles at the right concentration.

ELENA: [amazed] And here's where the story takes a wild turn. Kahn and his colleague, Dr. Paul Grant, obtained a supply of minoxidil - sources are unclear about exactly how - and they just... started experimenting. Neither Upjohn nor Chidsey were aware of this side experiment initially. Kahn basically went rogue. He saw the opportunity and he moved on it independently.

MARCUS: [surprised] Wait, he just did this without permission? That's incredibly bold.

ELENA: [intense] Incredibly bold! So they began mixing minoxidil at various concentrations. They started with a 1 percent solution. The vehicle was alcohol-based liquids - ethanol and propylene glycol. These create what's called a hydroalcoholic solution.

MARCUS: [curious] Why alcohol specifically? What does that do?

ELENA: [analytical] Alcohol serves multiple functions. It's a solvent - it dissolves the minoxidil crystals. It's a penetration enhancer - it helps the drug cross through the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of skin. And it evaporates quickly, so you don't have a greasy, wet scalp all day. Pretty elegant solution when you think about it.

ELENA: [engaged] So they're testing various formulation ratios on actual balding patients. What happens?

MARCUS: [delighted] It worked! 1971 - Kahn and Grant developed a working topical minoxidil formulation. They saw hair regrowth in test subjects. And crucially, topical application avoided the systemic side effects. Proof of concept was established.

ELENA: [excited] So they've just invented what will become Rogaine! They should be celebrating, right? Pop the champagne, call Upjohn, negotiate a licensing deal, become multimillionaires?

MARCUS: [contemplative] Not exactly.

ELENA: [concerned] Uh oh. What happened?

MARCUS: [serious] What followed was a 15-year legal battle over who actually invented the use of minoxidil for hair loss. But before we get into that mess, we need to understand why Upjohn initially wanted nothing to do with this opportunity.

## Upjohn's Cultural Crisis

ELENA: [curious] Okay, I need to understand this. Kahn just proved topical minoxidil works for hair loss. He's got results. Why would Upjohn resist? This seems like the most obvious business opportunity in pharmaceutical history.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] There's a quote from the research that perfectly captures their mindset: "Founded in 1886 to make friable pills, Upjohn now part of Pfizer had a well earned reputation for serious pharmaceutical research, and did not want to get caught up in miracle baldness cures."

ELENA: [surprised] "Miracle baldness cures." Oh my god, they saw this as beneath them!

MARCUS: [serious] This was a cultural crisis for Upjohn. They were a serious pharmaceutical company. They developed lifesaving medications for cardiovascular disease, infections, serious conditions.

ELENA: [passionate] And hair loss treatment was seen as frivolous! Cosmetic! Not "real medicine!" It's like the Mayo Clinic deciding to offer Botox. There's this whole identity crisis happening.

MARCUS: [contemplative] It had a snake oil reputation in the market. For decades, charlatans had been selling fake baldness cures. Upjohn worried about damaging their corporate reputation by association.

ELENA: [thoughtful] But they eventually changed their mind. So what breaks them? What shifts the calculation?

MARCUS: [analytical] Two forces. First, the market reality became impossible to ignore. By the mid-1980s, they're looking at 50 plus million men in the U.S. with male pattern baldness. Massive unmet need. No FDA-approved treatments. Men desperate for a legitimate solution.

ELENA: [excited] And this is a potential billion-dollar market! Not millions - BILLIONS. That's hard to walk away from, no matter how prestigious you think you are.

MARCUS: [engaged] Second force - business pressure. Upjohn was facing patent cliffs on their major drugs in the 1980s. Stock price concerns. They needed new revenue sources desperately.

ELENA: [intense] And here's the kicker - minoxidil for hypertension was disappointing commercially. It got squeezed out by ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. So they're sitting on this molecule that's failing in its original indication, and there's this massive opportunity right in front of them. The economics become overwhelming. They already had extensive safety data from the hypertension use. Development costs would be lower. The regulatory path was potentially faster. And the market opportunity was enormous.

ELENA: [triumphant] So necessity pushed them past their reputational concerns. This is the classic innovator's dilemma - your identity prevents you from seeing opportunity until you're desperate enough to look. They decided to pursue FDA approval for the hair loss indication. This meant investing in a comprehensive clinical trial program and developing a consumer product - which was completely unprecedented for Upjohn. They're going all in.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] But there's still the patent war to resolve.

## The 15-Year Patent Battle (1971-1986)

ELENA: [amazed] Right! So who owns this discovery? Upjohn, who made the molecule? Chidsey, who observed the side effect? Or Kahn and Grant, who developed the topical formulation?

MARCUS: [serious] All of them filed patent claims. The USPTO had to sort through competing inventorship claims. This dragged on for fifteen years—legal fees, depositions, expert witnesses. Meanwhile, dermatologists were experimenting with topical formulations off-label. An underground market was emerging.

ELENA: [energetic] People wanted this so badly they weren't waiting for the lawyers!

MARCUS: [contemplative] Finally, in 1986, a consolidated patent was issued. U.S. Patent Number 4,596,812. Both Charles A. Chidsey the Third and Guinter Kahn were named as co-inventors. Solomon's baby solution—split the credit.

ELENA: [curious] But what about the money?

MARCUS: [analytical] Kahn and Grant received royalty arrangements with Upjohn. 2 to 5 percent of wholesale revenues. When Rogaine hit approximately 200 million dollars in annual wholesale revenues, that meant Kahn was pulling in 4 to 10 million dollars per year.

ELENA: [amazed] Per YEAR! From a phone call and some lab experiments! That's generational wealth.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] And there's a tragic irony—Kahn himself was allergic to minoxidil. He could never use his own discovery. According to his daughter, "he loved tinkering around, doing research." He died in 2014 at age 80, a multimillionaire who couldn't benefit from his own invention.

ELENA: [serious] So the patent is resolved in 1986. But approval doesn't come until 1988. What happened in those two years?

MARCUS: [intrigued] The clinical trials and the FDA review process. And this is where things get really interesting from a regulatory standpoint.

ELENA: [excited] Should we take a quick break before we dive into the FDA trials?

MARCUS: [happy] Yeah sure. When we come back, we'll talk about how you convince the FDA that growing hair is medically important enough to deserve drug approval.

ELENA: [enthusiastic] And how you turn a pharmaceutical company into a consumer marketing machine overnight. Be right back!
