# Chapter 3 & 4: "The Battle for Billions" and "The FDA Gamble" (1985-1988)

## The Stakes

ELENA: [enthusiastic] Okay, we're in the mid-1980s now. Upjohn has been fighting this 15-year patent war, their major drugs are facing patent cliffs, and they're about to do something completely unprecedented for a "serious pharmaceutical company."

MARCUS: [curious] Which is?

ELENA: [excited] They're going to run full FDA clinical trials for something that is essentially cosmetic. Hair growth. Not cancer, not heart disease - hair. For a company that literally said "we have a well-earned reputation for serious pharmaceutical research, not miracle baldness cures," this is a massive identity crisis.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] But it's also a survival move. By the mid-1980s, they needed new revenue streams desperately. Sometimes business pressure breaks through cultural resistance.

ELENA: [impressed] Exactly. And they committed hard. We're talking about clinical trials that would ultimately involve more than 1,800 patients. That's enormous for what's essentially a quality-of-life indication.

MARCUS: [serious] And genuinely unprecedented from a regulatory perspective. No FDA-approved hair loss treatment existed, so there was no established pathway. They had to answer fundamental questions: What efficacy standard should apply? How do you measure success objectively?

ELENA: [intrigued] And philosophically - is hair growth even medical or cosmetic? Because that determines everything about how the FDA evaluates this.

MARCUS: [contemplative] That was the tension. And the answer would set precedent for an entire category of drugs.

## The Clinical Trial Design

ELENA: [curious] So how do you even design a trial for hair growth? I mean, it seems so subjective.

MARCUS: [methodical] Let me walk you through it. Multiple dermatology clinics across the United States. Study population: men with androgenetic alopecia - male pattern baldness. The formulation tested was 2 percent minoxidil topical solution. One milliliter applied to the scalp twice daily.

ELENA: [surprised] Wait, why 2 percent specifically? Why not go higher for better results?

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Dose-finding had to balance efficacy with safety. Remember, they already knew from hypertension use that higher doses caused more systemic side effects. For topical application, you want enough drug to reach the follicles but minimal absorption into the bloodstream. Two percent was the sweet spot they landed on.

ELENA: [fascinated] And the delivery system? I dug into this - the vehicle matters as much as the drug itself, right?

MARCUS: [pleased] Absolutely. What did you find?

ELENA: [excited] Alcohol-based solution - ethanol, propylene glycol, and purified water. This is basically Kahn and Grant's original formulation from the early 1970s, now refined for commercial use. The alcohol helps the minoxidil penetrate the scalp, but it also makes your hair look wet and greasy, which becomes a problem later.

MARCUS: [serious] That cosmetic elegance issue would haunt them for years. But for the trials, they needed consistency. Placebo group got the vehicle without minoxidil - critical for demonstrating the drug was actually causing hair growth, not just scalp stimulation from massage or the vehicle itself.

ELENA: [engaged] Okay, but measurement. How did they avoid this being subjective? Because I can imagine people seeing what they want to see.

MARCUS: [methodical] Multiple assessment methods working together. Standardized photography of the vertex and crown area - same angle, same lighting, at regular intervals. Target area hair counts - literally counting individual hairs in a precisely defined region. Patient self-assessment. Investigator global assessment. And importantly, tolerability and safety monitoring throughout.

ELENA: [impressed] So this is rigorous. They're treating this like a Phase 3 oncology trial, not a cosmetic product test.

MARCUS: [contemplative] That was essential for FDA credibility. If they wanted pharmaceutical legitimacy, they needed pharmaceutical-level evidence.

## The December 1985 Submission

ELENA: [anticipatory] So December 1985 - they submit to the FDA. I want to talk about what happened next because this gets wild with the regulatory precedent-setting.

MARCUS: [curious] What did you dig up?

ELENA: [excited] Okay, so the data package included results from treating more than 1,800 patients across multiple clinical trial sites. Controlled studies with placebo comparison, safety data, efficacy endpoints clearly defined. They submitted in December 1985, and then in April 1986, they made the results public.

MARCUS: [serious] And here's where we need to be precise about the numbers, because they matter. April 1986, the results showed: 39 percent of men experienced moderate to dense hair growth on the crown of the head.

ELENA: [shocked] Wait, hold on. Only 39 percent?

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Only 39 percent achieved what would be considered clinically significant regrowth - moderate to dense. There was an additional roughly 40 percent who showed some improvement or slowed loss. But for dramatic, visible regrowth that people would actually notice, we're talking about 39 percent of study participants.

ELENA: [concerned] That seems problematic. Most drugs need to show better than 50 percent response rates to get approved, right?

MARCUS: [contemplative] Usually, yes. Typically FDA looks for majority response. But here's where the FDA made a really interesting regulatory decision that I want to explore with you.

ELENA: [intrigued] Tell me.

MARCUS: [serious] This was a quality-of-life indication, not a life-threatening disease. There were zero alternatives - literally no FDA-approved treatments for hair loss existed. And even modest improvement might be meaningful for patients who had no other options whatsoever.

ELENA: [fascinated] So they're creating a different efficacy threshold based on context. That's huge. The FDA is basically saying "we will accept lower efficacy if this is the first treatment for an unmet need in a non-fatal condition."

MARCUS: [agreeing] Exactly. The FDA's official conclusion was: "Although the product will not work for everyone, 39 percent of the men studied had moderate to dense hair growth on the crown of the head." They accepted that efficacy standard explicitly.

ELENA: [amazed] This is a precedent-setting decision that opens the door for an entire category of lifestyle drugs. And I bet pharma companies were watching this closely.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] They absolutely were. But the FDA wasn't just being permissive. They were also unusually demanding in other ways during the review process.

## The Name Controversy

ELENA: [curious] Wait, I want to talk about the name controversy because this is hilarious.

MARCUS: [amused] The "Regain" debacle?

ELENA: [excited] Yes! So I found this - Upjohn proposed "Regain" as the brand name. From a marketing perspective, it's perfect: you're "regaining" your hair. Simple, direct, memorable. And the FDA said no.

MARCUS: [curious] Why did they reject it?

ELENA: [explaining] The FDA said it was misleading because the name implied that patients would regain all their hair. Remember, only 39 percent were getting moderate to dense regrowth. The other 61 percent were getting modest improvement at best, or nothing at all. The FDA was concerned about false advertising and unrealistic expectations.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] That's actually a pretty sophisticated regulatory position. They're not just evaluating efficacy, they're evaluating how the name itself shapes patient expectations.

ELENA: [triumphant] Right! So they went with "Rogaine" instead. Still implies hair gain - "Ro-gain" - but less direct, less of an explicit promise. The FDA approved that.

MARCUS: [intrigued] But here's the kicker-

ELENA: [laughing] I know! Outside the United States, it's sold as Regaine. Everywhere else in the world uses the name the FDA said was too misleading for American consumers.

MARCUS: [amused] That's the quirk of regulatory jurisdictions. What's misleading in the U.S. is apparently fine in Europe, Asia, Latin America.

ELENA: [delighted] And I love that this means Americans are walking around using "Rogaine" while the rest of the world uses the more straightforward name Upjohn wanted in the first place.

## Label Innovation and Regulatory Honesty

MARCUS: [serious] But the name was just one piece of the approval puzzle. The FDA also had to decide what could be claimed on the label, and this is actually one of the most important precedents Rogaine set.

ELENA: [curious] What did the label end up saying?

MARCUS: [methodical] The label was brutally honest about limitations in a way that was unusual for pharmaceutical marketing. It stated explicitly: 39 percent of men experienced moderate to dense regrowth. Not everyone responds. Results take 4 months or more to appear. Continuous use is required to maintain results. Stopping leads to hair loss resumption within 6 to 12 months.

ELENA: [impressed] That's refreshingly honest. Most drug marketing tries to bury the limitations in fine print.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] The FDA insisted on it because they wanted realistic expectations. But there's more. The label also specified that approval was for the vertex - the crown of the head - not the frontal hairline or receding temples.

ELENA: [surprised] Wait, it doesn't work on the hairline? That's like the main thing men care about when they're going bald!

MARCUS: [explaining] It works less well on frontal baldness. We still don't fully understand why. Different follicle biology in different scalp regions? Different blood supply? Different androgen receptor density? It's unclear. But the FDA approval was specifically for vertex baldness based on where the evidence was strongest.

ELENA: [amazed] So if you're a guy with a receding hairline at the temples, which is the most visible form of balding, Rogaine wasn't even approved for that. This is a much more limited treatment than people probably realized.

MARCUS: [serious] Correct. Though obviously people tried to use it off-label for frontal recession. But the official indication was vertex balding only.

ELENA: [contemplative] This is fascinating because the FDA is being unusually conservative on claims while simultaneously being unusually permissive on efficacy thresholds. They're allowing the drug with lower response rates, but forcing extreme honesty about what it can and can't do.

MARCUS: [agreeing] That's exactly the balance they struck. Lower efficacy bar, higher transparency requirement.

## August 18, 1988: Approval Day

ELENA: [excited] Okay, so after all of this - the 15-year patent war between Kahn and Upjohn, the clinical trials with 1,800 patients, the regulatory review and name controversy - when did approval finally come?

MARCUS: [ceremonial] August 18, 1988. FDA approves Rogaine for men for treatment of male pattern baldness, specifically androgenetic alopecia. Two percent minoxidil topical solution. One milliliter applied twice daily to affected areas of the scalp. Prescription only, initially.

ELENA: [intrigued] Prescription only - so you needed to see a doctor, get a prescription, go to a pharmacy. That's a significant barrier to access.

MARCUS: [serious] It was. And the label had extensive warnings. Not for women - at least not yet. Not for people under 18. Stop if you experience chest pain, rapid heartbeat, faintness, dizziness, sudden weight gain, or swollen hands or feet.

ELENA: [concerned] Those are serious cardiovascular warnings.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Because this was originally a hypertension drug. The FDA wanted patients monitored for any systemic cardiovascular effects, even though topical application should minimize systemic absorption. Better safe than sorry for a cosmetic indication.

ELENA: [curious] Wait, women weren't included in the initial approval. Why?

MARCUS: [explaining] The clinical trials had been in men only. They needed separate efficacy studies for women because hair loss patterns differ - women get diffuse thinning rather than vertex balding. Hormonal factors are more complex. And they needed to establish safety, particularly regarding pregnancy risk.

ELENA: [concerned] How long did women have to wait?

MARCUS: [matter-of-fact] Three years. 1991. Women's Rogaine, same 2 percent formulation, was approved after separate clinical trials. But that three-year delay meant that for the initial launch, this was a men-only treatment.

ELENA: [frustrated] So for three years, if you were a woman dealing with hair loss, you're watching this treatment get approved and marketed to men, knowing you have to wait just because they didn't include women in the initial trials.

MARCUS: [serious] That's the reality of how clinical trial inclusion worked in the 1980s. Women of childbearing age were often excluded from trials due to pregnancy concerns, which meant treatments took longer to reach them.

ELENA: [determined] This is one of the reasons why there's been such a push for better representation in clinical trials over the past few decades.

## Market Launch Strategy

ELENA: [excited] Okay, so late 1988, Rogaine hits pharmacy shelves. Let me talk about the launch strategy because Upjohn did something really interesting here.

MARCUS: [curious] What did you find?

ELENA: [enthusiastic] They launched with a direct-to-consumer advertising campaign, which was still relatively novel in the late 1980s. Remember, the FDA had only recently loosened restrictions on pharmaceutical advertising directly to patients. Before this, drug companies mainly marketed to physicians.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] So they're betting that patient demand will drive prescriptions?

ELENA: [confirming] Exactly. They're creating consumer pull rather than just relying on physician push. But they're also doing medical education for physicians simultaneously, because doctors weren't used to prescribing cosmetic treatments. This was new territory - prescribing something for appearance rather than disease.

MARCUS: [serious] That cultural barrier was significant. For many physicians, especially primary care doctors, prescribing something for cosmetic purposes felt strange. This wasn't treating disease, it was treating appearance.

ELENA: [engaged] And they went premium pricing. Sources vary, but we're talking about 50 to 100 dollars per month or more in late-1980s dollars.

MARCUS: [calculating] In 2024 dollars, that's roughly 130 to 260 dollars per month. Expensive. And remember, you have to use it forever.

ELENA: [amazed] Forever. That's the key to the business model, which we need to talk about. But first, what was the early market response?

MARCUS: [recounting] Strong initial interest. Long wait times at pharmacies. Extensive media coverage - this was a big news story. But also significant skepticism. People had been burned by snake oil hair loss cures for decades. Some thought this was just another scam, even with an FDA stamp on it.

ELENA: [understanding] Because the hair loss industry had been dominated by frauds and false promises for so long.

MARCUS: [agreeing] Exactly. Hair clubs, toupees, spray-on hair, scalp massage devices - most of it was nonsense. So even with FDA approval, there was consumer skepticism.

## The Skepticism and Criticism

ELENA: [curious] What were the critics saying? Because 39 percent efficacy is not overwhelming.

MARCUS: [serious] The medical community was genuinely split. Supporters argued this was the first FDA-approved treatment, evidence-based efficacy, filled a genuine unmet need, and quality of life improvement was measurable. But skeptics raised valid concerns.

ELENA: [intrigued] Like what?

MARCUS: [methodical] Only 39 percent achieve moderate to dense regrowth - meaning most people won't see dramatic results. It's expensive for what may be modest benefit. It requires continuous use forever. It stops working when you discontinue. And philosophically, some doctors questioned whether this was even "real medicine" or just vanity treatment.

ELENA: [thoughtful] Those are fair critiques. But the philosophical one is interesting because it gets at how we define medicine. Is treating psychological distress from hair loss legitimate medicine?

MARCUS: [contemplative] That's the question. If hair loss causes genuine psychological suffering - anxiety, depression, social withdrawal - and treatment improves quality of life, isn't that legitimate?

ELENA: [agreeing] Exactly. And consumer reactions were similarly mixed, right?

MARCUS: [recounting] On the positive side, people were relieved to finally have a legitimate option from a real drug company - Upjohn, not some guy selling bottles out of his garage. FDA-approved, not snake oil. And some men had excellent results, visible dramatic improvement.

ELENA: [anticipating] But the negative side?

MARCUS: [serious] Many were frustrated by the "doesn't work for everyone" reality. It takes 4 to 6 months to see results, requiring serious patience. The cost over a lifetime is substantial. And there was real disappointment when results were more modest than marketing suggested.

ELENA: [concerned] Did the marketing oversell it?

MARCUS: [measured] Some media coverage oversold it. Before-and-after photos could be misleading - showing best responders, optimal lighting, favorable angles. This created unrealistic expectations. When someone's personal results were modest, they felt misled.

ELENA: [understanding] So Upjohn had to walk a tightrope: generate enthusiasm to drive sales, but manage expectations to avoid backlash. All while the FDA is watching for false claims.

MARCUS: [agreeing] Exactly. And despite the complications, it was a commercial success. We're talking about 200 million dollars in wholesale annual revenues at peak in the late 1980s.

ELENA: [impressed] That's enormous for a cosmetic treatment. Shall we talk about the business model? Because this is where it gets really interesting.

## The Subscription Business Model

ELENA: [excited] Before we move on, I need to talk about what Upjohn accidentally invented here—the subscription drug model.

MARCUS: [curious] What do you mean?

ELENA: [explaining] Most drugs cure something or manage it until you can stop. Antibiotics—one week, done. But Rogaine is different. It only works while you're using it. Stop, and you lose everything within 6 to 12 months.

MARCUS: [realizing] Continuous intervention, not a cure.

ELENA: [enthusiastic] This creates a subscription revenue stream decades before Netflix. At 50 to 100 dollars per month in 1980s prices, that's 600 to 1,200 dollars per year. Over 10 years, you're looking at 6,000 to 12,000 dollars per patient in 1980s dollars—or 15,000 to 30,000 in today's money.

MARCUS: [contemplative] Multiply that by millions of users globally, and you see the business model. Chronic-use drugs are more profitable than cures.

ELENA: [serious] Which is ethically fraught. Are we incentivizing management over cures?

MARCUS: [thoughtful] That's the tension. A one-time cure generates revenue once. Chronic treatment generates revenue forever. Rogaine pioneered that model, and Viagra, Cialis, weight loss drugs all followed.

ELENA: [impressed] Being first to market with FDA approval created durable brand equity that persisted even after generics entered in 1996.

---

## Breaking Point

MARCUS: [serious] Okay, so we've got FDA approval in 1988, market launch with premium pricing, commercial success hitting 200 million dollars in annual wholesale revenues. But the story doesn't end there.

ELENA: [anticipating] Right, because women had to wait three years for approval. And then there were higher concentrations developed. And the patent expired, forcing a complete strategy shift. And the foam formulation. And then, most bizarrely, people started taking oral minoxidil deliberately for the side effect it was originally designed to avoid.

MARCUS: [agreeing] The story gets more interesting after approval than before. But we've covered the regulatory gamble and the FDA precedent-setting approval. Should we take a break before we dive into the expansion era?

ELENA: [enthusiastic] Shall we take a break?

MARCUS: [agreeable] Yeah, let's do it. When we come back, we'll cover 1991 to the present - how Rogaine evolved through multiple formulations, what happened when the patent expired in 1996 and generics flooded the market, the over-the-counter switch that changed everything, and why dermatologists today are prescribing oral minoxidil for hair loss despite decades of trying to avoid that exact outcome.

ELENA: [excited] The repurposing story that keeps repurposing itself.

MARCUS: [amused] Exactly. We'll be right back.
