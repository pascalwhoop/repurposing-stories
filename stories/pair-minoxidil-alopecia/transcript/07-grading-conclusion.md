# The Grading: How Successful Was Minoxidil's Repurposing?

ELENA: [energetic] Alright, Marcus. The moment of truth. Time to put our cards on the table and grade this thing.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Five dimensions. Financial impact, scientific innovation, patient benefit, cultural transformation, and repurposing as blueprint. We grade each one separately, then converge on an overall assessment.

ELENA: [excited] And we're not going easy on it just because it's a compelling story. This needs to be rigorous.

MARCUS: [serious] Agreed. Let's start with the dimension everyone cares about—money.

---

## Financial Impact: The Business Success

ELENA: [intense] Financial impact. Peak revenues around 200 million annually in the late 80s. That's solid, but it's not Viagra territory.

MARCUS: [analytical] Right. Viagra hit over a billion dollars annually at its peak. So by mega-blockbuster standards, Rogaine underperformed. But context matters—what about cumulative revenue?

ELENA: [thoughtful] Multi-billions over 35-plus years. That's where it gets interesting. This wasn't a flash-in-the-pan success. Rogaine survived patent expiration in 1996, survived OTC competition, survived multiple corporate ownership changes, and it's still here in 2024.

MARCUS: [impressed] The endurance is remarkable. Most drugs don't sustain relevance for three and a half decades. And from an ROI perspective?

ELENA: [animated] Oh, the ROI is insane! They already had all the safety data from the hypertension trials. They didn't need to do extensive toxicology, animal studies—most of that was done. So the incremental R&D cost for repurposing was relatively low. Tens of millions, not hundreds of millions.

MARCUS: [contemplative] And the returns were billions. That's an extraordinary return on investment. But here's what I think pushes it higher—market creation. Minoxidil didn't just compete in an existing market. It created the market.

ELENA: [triumphant] Exactly! Before Rogaine, there was no hair loss treatment industry. Hair transplants existed but were primitive and expensive. After Rogaine? We've got a 450-billion-dollar global hair care market focused on thinning hair and scalp health. Rogaine legitimized the entire category.

MARCUS: [serious] So the question is: Do we grade it on direct revenues, or do we credit it for spawning an entire industry?

ELENA: [passionate] Both! You can't separate them. Rogaine's direct success enabled everything else. And let's not forget Kahn and Grant—they got 2 to 5 percent royalties on wholesale revenues. At 200 million a year, that's 4 to 10 million dollars annually. Kahn died a multimillionaire from one scientific observation and a few lab experiments.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Okay, so I'm hearing A-minus. Not quite A-plus because it never hit billion-dollar annual revenues. But sustained profitability for decades, market creation worth hundreds of billions, excellent ROI, and life-changing wealth for the inventors. That's A-minus territory.

ELENA: [reflective] I could argue for a straight A on market impact alone. But yeah, A-minus is fair. It's not Viagra, but it's definitely elite-level commercial success.

MARCUS: [decisive] A-minus for financial impact. Agreed?

ELENA: [enthusiastic] Agreed. Next dimension.

## Scientific Innovation: Mechanism and Discovery

MARCUS: [analytical] Scientific innovation. This is where it gets complicated. How important was minoxidil scientifically?

ELENA: [curious] Okay, walk me through this. Because there's the discovery itself, and then there's what we learned from it.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Start with the discovery. It was serendipitous but not accidental. Chidsey observed the hair growth, recognized its significance, and consulted the right expert. That's good science. Not a lab accident—deliberate observation followed by systematic investigation.

ELENA: [engaged] And Kahn and Grant developed the topical formulation in their lab. That required innovation too. They figured out the alcohol-based vehicle, the concentration, the application method. That's translational science at its best.

MARCUS: [serious] Right. But mechanistically, we still don't fully understand how it works after 40 years. Multiple pathways are involved—vasodilation, potassium channel opening, growth factor upregulation, effects on hair follicle cycling. But we can't say which is primary or how they integrate.

ELENA: [intrigued] But didn't the sulfotransferase discovery come from this? That's a real contribution.

MARCUS: [impressed] Yes. The prodrug activation via sulfotransferase explained why some people don't respond. That was a genuine mechanistic insight that came decades after approval. And it opened the door to pharmacogenetic testing—you could theoretically screen for enzyme activity to predict response.

ELENA: [thoughtful] And the research boom it triggered? Hair biology wasn't a serious field before Rogaine. After FDA approval, funding poured in. Entire research careers were built on understanding hair follicle physiology, growth factors, stem cell niches. That's real scientific impact.

MARCUS: [contemplative] But here's my concern—after 40 years, we still have fundamental gaps. Why does the vertex respond better than the frontal scalp? Why is individual variation so high? Why do some people get dramatic regrowth and others nothing? Incomplete understanding limits our ability to improve the drug or develop next-generation treatments.

ELENA: [reflective] So you're penalizing it for what we don't know rather than rewarding it for what we do know?

MARCUS: [analytical] Both matter. It made real contributions—prodrug activation, hair biology research boom, growth factor understanding. But the persistent mechanistic gaps prevent a top-tier grade. This isn't like statins where we deeply understand cholesterol synthesis pathways.

ELENA: [curious] Okay, so what's the grade? I'm thinking B-plus. Significant contributions but incomplete understanding.

MARCUS: [serious] I'm right there with you. B-plus. It demonstrated that serendipitous discovery plus systematic development works. It advanced the field. But we're still figuring out how it works. That's a limitation.

ELENA: [agreeable] B-plus for scientific innovation. Fair assessment. Next?

---

## Patient Benefit: Lives Changed

ELENA: [engaged] Patient benefit. This is the heart of it. How much did minoxidil actually help people?

MARCUS: [analytical] Let's start with the numbers. 39 percent of men achieve moderate to dense regrowth—that's the efficacy threshold that got FDA approval. An additional 40 percent or so get modest improvement or maintenance. So roughly 80 percent of users experience some benefit.

ELENA: [thoughtful] But only 40 percent get dramatic results. The kind of regrowth where someone looks at you and says, "Hey, you've got more hair." That's less than half.

MARCUS: [contemplative] True. But we need to talk about the maintenance effect. Slowing or stopping hair loss, even without regrowth, is valuable. If you start minoxidil at 30 and it prevents significant loss for two decades, that's meaningful—even if you never regrow what's already gone.

ELENA: [curious] How many people understand that distinction? Because I feel like most users expect regrowth, not just maintenance.

MARCUS: [serious] That's a communication challenge. The clinical benefit is real—slowing progression is medically meaningful. But patient expectations often exceed reality. They see "hair loss treatment" and think "hair restoration."

ELENA: [reflective] And the limitations are significant. It only works while you're using it. Stop, and you lose the benefit within 6 to 12 months. It requires continuous expense over a lifetime—hundreds of dollars a year, thousands over decades. And 20 percent are non-responders who get nothing.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Right. This isn't a cure. It's chronic management of a progressive condition. That's a fundamentally different proposition than, say, an antibiotic that cures an infection.

ELENA: [intrigued] But what about the indirect benefits? The psychological impact of having a legitimate treatment option, even if the physical results are modest?

MARCUS: [impressed] That matters. The legitimacy itself is therapeutic. Before Rogaine, if you had hair loss, you had no medical options. The existence of an FDA-approved treatment said: This is real, this is legitimate, you're not vain for caring. The psychological benefit of that validation may exceed the direct physical benefit for some patients.

ELENA: [passionate] And it reduced stigma! It made seeking treatment acceptable. It expanded research into other options. The ripple effects on patient experience go beyond just the hair that grows back.

MARCUS: [analytical] So how do we grade this? On one hand, 40 percent dramatic responders, another 40 percent with modest benefit. That's 80 percent getting something. On the other hand, lifelong use required, no cure, modest effects for many, costly over time.

ELENA: [contemplative] I'm thinking B. Definitely helps a substantial portion of users. Quality of life improvements are real and measurable. But the limitations are significant—it's management, not a cure. And expectations often exceed reality.

MARCUS: [serious] I agree. B for patient benefit. It's not a game-changer for most people, but it's meaningful for many. Solid, useful, but not transformative at the individual level.

ELENA: [agreeable] B it is. And honestly, that tracks with the 39 percent efficacy. It's good, but not great. Next dimension?

---

## Cultural Transformation: Societal Impact

ELENA: [excited] Okay, cultural transformation. This is where I think minoxidil really shines. Marcus, the cultural impact was massive.

MARCUS: [curious] Make the case.

ELENA: [passionate] Before Rogaine in 1988, hair loss treatment was stigmatized. If you sought treatment, you were considered vain or desperate. There were no legitimate medical options—just snake oil and toupees. Cosmetic concerns weren't "real medicine."

MARCUS: [thoughtful] And after?

ELENA: [triumphant] Everything changed! FDA approval conferred legitimacy. Hair loss became a medical condition worthy of treatment, not a character flaw. Appearance medicine became respectable. Doctors started discussing cosmetic concerns openly. The entire field of cosmetic dermatology emerged from this precedent.

MARCUS: [analytical] That's a bold claim. You're saying Rogaine enabled Botox, fillers, cosmetic procedures?

ELENA: [intense] Yes! Think about the regulatory precedent. The FDA accepted 39 percent efficacy for a quality-of-life indication. They approved a drug for something purely cosmetic. That opened the floodgates. Botox for wrinkles in 2002, dermal fillers, body contouring devices—all of these followed the pathway Rogaine carved.

MARCUS: [impressed] That's actually true. Before minoxidil, the FDA hadn't approved a drug primarily for appearance. It set the precedent that quality-of-life improvements—including cosmetic ones—could justify pharmaceutical approval.

ELENA: [excited] And the market creation! Minoxidil didn't just create a product category. It created an entire industry. Hair transplant surgery went from fringe to mainstream. Laser therapy devices, platelet-rich plasma treatments, specialized supplements, medical-grade shampoos, telehealth platforms like Hims and Hers—none of this existed before Rogaine legitimized the category.

MARCUS: [contemplative] The 450-billion-dollar global hair care market focused on thinning hair and scalp health. Rogaine is a fraction of that directly, but it enabled the whole thing.

ELENA: [animated] Exactly! And culturally, attitudes shifted dramatically. In the 1980s, seeking hair loss treatment was embarrassing. By the 2000s and 2010s, proactive treatment was encouraged. Celebrities openly discussed their hair transplants and regimens. The stigma disappeared.

MARCUS: [serious] What about the gender dimension? The approval for women came three years after men—1991 versus 1988.

ELENA: [passionate] That delay is frustrating, but the approval itself mattered. Female pattern hair loss was barely acknowledged before. Women suffered in silence. The FDA approval said: This is a real medical issue affecting women. That cultural validation was huge.

MARCUS: [reflective] So you're arguing for a top-tier grade on cultural transformation?

ELENA: [emphatic] Absolutely! This was revolutionary. Pioneered the lifestyle drug category. Legitimized appearance medicine. Changed FDA regulatory approach. Created an industry from nothing. Shifted cultural attitudes from stigma to acceptance. That's A-level impact.

MARCUS: [impressed] I'm not going to argue. The societal impact was genuinely transformative. Rogaine changed how we think about cosmetic medicine, quality-of-life indications, and pharmaceutical development. A for cultural transformation.

ELENA: [triumphant] Yes! Okay, we're on a roll. Final dimension.

## Repurposing as Blueprint: Lessons for the Future

MARCUS: [analytical] Last dimension: How good is minoxidil as a blueprint for future drug repurposing efforts?

ELENA: [curious] What makes a good blueprint? Like, what criteria are we using?

MARCUS: [thoughtful] It should demonstrate generalizable lessons. It should show clear decision points. It should have succeeded for replicable reasons, not just luck. And it should inspire others to look for similar opportunities.

ELENA: [engaged] Okay, so generalizable lessons. What does minoxidil teach us?

MARCUS: [serious] First, observe side effects systematically. Chidsey noticed the hair growth and took it seriously instead of dismissing it. That's replicable—every clinical trial produces side effect data that should be analyzed for repurposing potential.

ELENA: [excited] Second, cross-disciplinary collaboration. Chidsey was a cardiologist. He didn't try to solve it himself—he called a dermatologist. Kahn saw opportunity because he had different expertise and a different lens. That's a clear lesson: bring in experts from other fields.

MARCUS: [analytical] Third, commercial viability. Kahn identified 50 million men with male pattern baldness and zero FDA-approved treatments. That's a market need. Repurposing works when you match an effect to an unmet need.

ELENA: [passionate] Fourth, existing safety data is gold. Upjohn didn't need to do extensive toxicology because they already had years of safety data from hypertension use. That accelerated development and reduced costs. Repurposing is attractive because you skip the riskiest, most expensive early phases.

MARCUS: [contemplative] And fifth, regulatory innovation. The FDA had never approved a cosmetic indication before. Rogaine proved it was possible. That precedent opened doors for other quality-of-life drugs.

ELENA: [intrigued] Did minoxidil inspire other repurposing efforts?

MARCUS: [serious] Absolutely. Sildenafil's story parallels minoxidil—angina side effect becomes Viagra. Thalidomide's revival for cancer and leprosy came after. Bupropion for smoking cessation. Repurposing became a recognized strategy partly because minoxidil proved it could work commercially.

ELENA: [thoughtful] But are there limitations as a blueprint? Like, what can't be replicated?

MARCUS: [analytical] The serendipity element can't be planned. You can't design a trial to discover unexpected side effects—you have to observe and recognize them when they happen. That requires curiosity and open-mindedness, which aren't easily systematized.

ELENA: [curious] What about the patent war? That 15-year battle between Kahn and Upjohn was messy.

MARCUS: [serious] Right. The legal complexity is a limitation. Who owns the discovery? The person who observed it, or the company that developed the original drug? That ambiguity creates risk. But ultimately they settled—the 1986 consolidated patent named both parties, and Kahn got his royalties. So even the patent issue resolved.

ELENA: [reflective] And the incomplete mechanistic understanding? We still don't fully know how minoxidil works after 40 years.

MARCUS: [contemplative] That's a double-edged lesson. On one hand, you don't need to fully understand the mechanism to get FDA approval and commercial success. Evidence-based efficacy can precede mechanistic understanding. On the other hand, incomplete understanding limits your ability to optimize, personalize, or improve. It's not ideal, but it's not disqualifying.

ELENA: [engaged] So overall, as a model for repurposing?

MARCUS: [thoughtful] I think A-minus. It's an excellent model with clear, actionable lessons. It's taught in pharmaceutical development courses as a textbook case. It inspired numerous other repurposing efforts. But some elements like serendipity and patent complexity reduce perfect replicability. Still, A-minus is a strong grade.

ELENA: [agreeable] A-minus works for me. It's not a perfect template—every drug repurposing will have unique challenges. But the core lessons are solid and generalizable.

MARCUS: [decisive] A-minus for repurposing blueprint. Agreed.

ELENA: [excited] Agreed. Okay, we've graded all five dimensions. Let's converge on the overall grade.

---

## The Overall Grade

ELENA: [energetic] Alright, let's tally this up. Financial impact: A-minus. Scientific innovation: B-plus. Patient benefit: B. Cultural transformation: A. Repurposing blueprint: A-minus.

MARCUS: [analytical] How do we weight these? Because financial success is important, but it's not the only thing that matters.

ELENA: [thoughtful] Right. If we weight everything equally, we're at about B-plus to A-minus overall. But I don't think equal weighting is right.

MARCUS: [contemplative] Agreed. I think cultural transformation and repurposing blueprint are the most important long-term dimensions. Those have lasting impact beyond just this drug.

ELENA: [curious] So what are you thinking for the overall grade?

MARCUS: [serious] A-minus. Here's my reasoning: It's not quite an A-plus mega-success like Viagra—the patient benefit is more modest, the mechanistic understanding is incomplete, the efficacy isn't as dramatic. But it's definitely not a B. The cultural transformation was revolutionary. The financial success sustained for 35-plus years. The repurposing blueprint inspired an entire strategy. This is one of the most successful drug repurposing stories in pharmaceutical history.

ELENA: [reflective] I think A-minus is exactly right. It's not perfect, but it's really, really good. And honestly, what would have made it an A-plus?

MARCUS: [analytical] Higher efficacy—if 70 to 80 percent of people got dramatic regrowth instead of 40 percent. Complete mechanistic understanding that enabled personalization. A cure rather than chronic management. Broader applicability—if it worked equally well on frontal baldness, not just the vertex. But even without those, this is a remarkable success.

ELENA: [passionate] And the story! The narrative is perfect. Failed ulcer drug becomes disappointing hypertension medication with a hairy problem. Phone call between cardiologist and dermatologist. 15-year patent war. FDA precedent-setting. Billion-dollar blockbuster. You couldn't write a better drug repurposing story if you tried.

MARCUS: [impressed] The story matters because it teaches. Every pharmaceutical company now knows to study side effects carefully. Every entrepreneur knows that one person's bug can be another person's feature. Every regulator knows that quality-of-life indications matter. Those lessons came directly from minoxidil.

ELENA: [excited] Okay, I'm sold. A-minus overall. Final grade for minoxidil's repurposing: A-minus.

MARCUS: [decisive] A-minus it is. Let's contextualize that. An A-minus means this is an elite-level success with minor limitations. It achieved transformative impact across multiple dimensions. It created lasting value. It changed how medicine, business, and society think about hair loss and appearance medicine.

ELENA: [contemplative] And 35 years later, it's still relevant. Still the gold standard topical treatment. Still generating revenue. Still teaching lessons. That endurance is part of why it deserves an A-minus.

MARCUS: [serious] Exactly. This isn't a historical curiosity. Minoxidil is still actively used by millions of people in 2024. Still being studied. Still being improved—oral low-dose minoxidil is the latest iteration. The story isn't over.

ELENA: [amazed] From hypertension side effect to 35-plus-year cultural phenomenon. That's an A-minus repurposing success.

---

## Final Reflections: What Minoxidil Teaches Us

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Let's step back. What's the single biggest lesson from the minoxidil story?

ELENA: [reflective] I think it's about observation. Chidsey was testing a hypertension drug. He could have dismissed the hair growth as an irrelevant cosmetic nuisance. Instead, he recognized potential importance and consulted experts. That observation, that curiosity, that willingness to explore the unexpected—that's what transformed a disappointing drug into a cultural phenomenon.

MARCUS: [impressed] Well said. Observation plus action. Chidsey noticed, but Kahn acted. The combination mattered. If Chidsey had noticed but done nothing, or if Kahn had been too skeptical to pursue it, nothing would have happened.

ELENA: [engaged] What's the second biggest lesson?

MARCUS: [analytical] Cultural barriers matter more than technical barriers. The science of topical minoxidil wasn't complicated—Kahn and Grant figured it out in a lab in 1971. But getting Upjohn to pursue it, getting the medical community to accept it, getting the FDA to approve it—that took 17 years. Innovation is often blocked by identity and gatekeeping, not by technology.

ELENA: [passionate] Yes! Upjohn resisted for years because they had a "well-earned reputation for serious pharmaceutical research, not miracle baldness cures." That's pure ego. And it nearly killed a billion-dollar opportunity. Business desperation—the patent cliff in the 1980s—is what finally broke through the cultural resistance.

MARCUS: [contemplative] Third lesson?

ELENA: [thoughtful] You don't need perfect understanding to create value. We still don't fully understand minoxidil's mechanism 40 years later. But that didn't prevent it from helping millions of people. Pragmatic empiricism—clinical evidence plus systematic observation—can succeed while mechanistic research continues.

MARCUS: [serious] That's a double-edged lesson, though. Not understanding the mechanism limits your ability to improve. If we knew exactly how minoxidil worked, we could potentially design better analogs, predict responders, optimize treatment. But you're right—we didn't let perfect be the enemy of good.

ELENA: [curious] What about looking forward? What does minoxidil's story predict for the future of medicine?

MARCUS: [analytical] Three predictions. First, there are probably dozens or hundreds of drugs in use today with side effects that could become primary effects for different populations. We should systematically study side effect profiles looking for repurposing opportunities. That's not happening enough.

ELENA: [excited] Second prediction?

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Lifestyle drugs and quality-of-life indications will continue to grow. As we solve acute life-threatening conditions—infections, heart attacks, strokes—more pharmaceutical development will focus on chronic quality-of-life improvements. Appearance, cognition, sexual function, longevity. Minoxidil legitimized that entire category.

ELENA: [intrigued] And the third prediction?

MARCUS: [contemplative] Personalized medicine will transform repurposed drugs. We can now measure sulfotransferase activity to predict minoxidil response. In the future, genetic testing will tell you before you start whether you're likely to respond. That changes everything—no more months of trial and error, no more wasted money on drugs that won't work for you. Precision repurposing.

ELENA: [amazed] So minoxidil was the first chapter, not the whole story.

MARCUS: [serious] Exactly. It proved repurposing works commercially. It established regulatory pathways. It demonstrated that side effects can be therapeutic. And 35 years later, it's still teaching us how to innovate. The next generation of repurposed drugs will be smarter, faster, and more personalized—but they'll follow the path minoxidil carved.

## What Makes This Story Special

ELENA: [reflective] You know what strikes me most about this story, Marcus? It's so deeply human. It's not about some brilliant chemist having a eureka moment in a lab. It's about paying attention. Making a phone call. Fighting for recognition. Overcoming cultural resistance. Taking a bet on something your company thought was beneath them.

MARCUS: [contemplative] And it's about the millions of people who looked in the mirror, saw hair loss, and for the first time had a legitimate option. That matters profoundly. The 39 percent who got dramatic regrowth—that changed their lives. The 40 percent who maintained their hair instead of losing more—that matters too. Even the 20 percent non-responders benefited from the cultural shift that said: Seeking treatment is okay.

ELENA: [emotional] From ulcer research, to hypertension medication, to werewolf patients, to a dermatologist's vision, to a billion-dollar blockbuster. What a journey.

MARCUS: [impressed] And it all started with one observation in a clinical trial in 1971. A cardiologist noticing that his hypertension patients were getting hairy and thinking: This is strange. I should ask a dermatologist about this.

ELENA: [excited] That phone call between Chidsey and Kahn changed pharmaceutical history. One conversation.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] It did. And somewhere right now, there's probably another clinical trial happening. Another unexpected side effect being observed. Another opportunity to transform a defect into a feature. The question is: Will anyone notice? Will anyone make that phone call? Will anyone fight through the cultural resistance and regulatory uncertainty to bring it to patients?

ELENA: [passionate] That's what I hope people take from this story. Innovation isn't just about genius. It's about observation, curiosity, collaboration, persistence, and the willingness to challenge conventional thinking. Chidsey, Kahn, and Grant weren't superhuman. They just paid attention and acted on what they saw.

MARCUS: [serious] And they fought. Kahn fought Upjohn for 15 years over patents. He could have given up at any point. But he knew he was right, he knew it was valuable, and he persisted. That persistence matters.

ELENA: [reflective] So for anyone listening who works in drug development, clinical trials, or research: pay attention to the weird stuff. The unexpected findings. The side effects that don't make sense. That might be your billion-dollar opportunity.

MARCUS: [contemplative] And for anyone who's experienced hair loss and used minoxidil—or any other treatment—you're part of this story. You're part of the 35-year legacy that started with hairy hypertension patients and a curious cardiologist. That's pretty cool.

## Closing

ELENA: [warm] Alright, Marcus. I think we've thoroughly dissected this story. Final thoughts?

MARCUS: [reflective] Minoxidil's repurposing from hypertension to hair loss is one of the most successful and influential drug repositioning stories in pharmaceutical history. It created an industry. It changed medical practice. It shifted culture. It generated billions. And it proved that careful observation of the unexpected can transform medicine.

ELENA: [satisfied] A-minus. Elite-level success with enduring impact.

MARCUS: [agreeable] A-minus. Well-deserved.

ELENA: [happy] Thank you for joining us on this journey through pharmaceutical history, scientific discovery, and cultural transformation. I'm Elena Cross.

MARCUS: [warm] And I'm Dr. Marcus Hale. If you enjoyed this story of drug repurposing, serendipity, and persistence, please subscribe wherever you listen to podcasts. Share this episode with anyone interested in medicine, innovation, or great stories.

ELENA: [cheerful] And maybe check your own side effects. You never know—that annoying bug might be somebody else's killer feature. That defect might be the next billion-dollar opportunity.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Until next time, keep asking questions, keep observing carefully, and keep challenging assumptions. The next minoxidil story is out there waiting to be discovered. Someone just needs to notice it.

ELENA: [energetic] We'll see you next time on The Pivot!

MARCUS: [sincere] Take care, everyone.
