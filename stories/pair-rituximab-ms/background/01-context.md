# The Context: Multiple Sclerosis in the 1990s

## The Disease Landscape

### A Diagnosis of Despair

In the early 1990s, a multiple sclerosis diagnosis was devastating. Patients faced an unpredictable disease that attacked the protective myelin sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. The immune system, for reasons poorly understood, launched repeated attacks on the central nervous system.

The result: progressive disability. Vision loss. Difficulty walking. Cognitive decline. Fatigue so profound it made normal life impossible.

And there was virtually nothing doctors could do about it.

## The Standard of Care: Before 1993

Before 1993, MS treatment was largely supportive:

- **Corticosteroids** for acute relapses (methylprednisolone)
- **Symptomatic management** for pain, spasticity, bladder problems
- **Physical therapy** to maintain function
- **Prayers and hope**

The disease-modifying therapy (DMT) era had not yet begun. Doctors could treat symptoms and relapses, but they could not slow the underlying progression of disease.

## The First Glimmer of Hope: Interferon Beta (1993)

On July 23, 1993, the FDA approved **Betaseron (interferon beta-1b)**[^1], marking the first disease-modifying treatment for MS. This was revolutionary.

### The Interferon Era Begins

**1993:** Betaseron (interferon beta-1b)[^1] - subcutaneous injection every other day
**1996:** Avonex (interferon beta-1a)[^2] - intramuscular injection once weekly
**1998:** Rebif (interferon beta-1a)[^3] - subcutaneous injection three times weekly

### What Interferons Could Do

The interferon drugs represented genuine progress:

- Reduced relapse rates by approximately 30%[^4]
- Decreased new brain lesions on MRI[^4]
- Potentially slowed disability progression[^4]
- Gave patients hope and something to fight with

### What Interferons Could NOT Do

But the interferons had significant limitations:

**Moderate efficacy:** Many patients still experienced relapses and progression
**Frequent injections:** Daily or weekly injections were burdensome
**Flu-like side effects:** Fever, chills, muscle aches after each injection
**Injection site reactions:** Pain, redness, and sometimes skin necrosis
**No cure:** The disease continued progressing, just more slowly

**Most critically:** Interferons were **completely ineffective** in primary progressive MS (PPMS)[^5], the form of the disease that progresses relentlessly from onset without distinct relapses.

## The Prevailing Theory: It's a T-Cell Disease

### The Scientific Consensus

In the 1990s, the immunology community had reached consensus: **Multiple sclerosis was a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease.**

The evidence seemed clear:

- **Animal models:** Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was driven by autoreactive T cells
- **Pathology:** T cells were abundant in MS brain lesions
- **Mechanism:** CD4+ T cells recognizing myelin proteins appeared to drive the attack

B cells? They were considered bystanders—perhaps producing some antibodies, but not central to the disease process.

This belief would shape drug development for years. Therapeutic efforts focused on:

- Blocking T-cell activation
- Preventing T-cell migration into the CNS
- Modulating T-cell function with interferons

## The Market Opportunity

By the late 1990s, the MS drug market was emerging but still small:

- **Estimated 350,000 people with MS in the United States**[^6]
- **Over 2 million worldwide**[^6]
- **Annual treatment costs:** $10,000-$15,000 per patient for interferons[^7]
- **Total market size:** Approximately $1-2 billion annually[^7]

This was significant, but nothing compared to what was coming.

## The Unmet Need

As the century drew to a close, massive unmet medical needs remained:

1. **Better efficacy:** Reduce relapses by more than 30%
2. **Oral medications:** Eliminate frequent injections
3. **Treatment for PPMS:** Nothing worked for progressive disease
4. **Higher safety:** Fewer side effects
5. **More convenient dosing:** Less frequent administration

Into this landscape, an unlikely candidate would soon emerge: a cancer drug designed to kill B cells.

## What Made the 1990s Perfect for Rituximab's Entry

The stage was set for a revolutionary discovery:

- **Imaging advances:** MRI became standard, allowing precise tracking of disease activity
- **Immunology boom:** Understanding of immune mechanisms was rapidly advancing
- **Biotech maturity:** Monoclonal antibody technology was proven (rituximab itself showed the way in cancer)
- **Clinical trial infrastructure:** MS research networks were established
- **Patient advocacy:** The MS community was organized and desperate for better treatments

No one yet knew that the answer might not be blocking T cells, but depleting B cells.
