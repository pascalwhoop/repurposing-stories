# The Origin: Creating the First Cancer-Killing Antibody

## The CD20 Discovery

### The Target Emerges (Early 1980s)

The story of rituximab begins not with the drug itself, but with the discovery of its target: **CD20**, a protein found on the surface of B cells.

In the early 1980s, researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and other institutions were mapping the surface proteins on different types of blood cells[^1]. They identified CD20 as a molecule expressed on:

- **Pre-B cells** and **mature B cells**
- **NOT on early stem cells** or plasma cells
- **B-cell lymphomas** (cancerous B cells)

This pattern made CD20 an attractive target: destroy B cells expressing CD20, but spare the stem cells that could regenerate new, healthy B cells later.

## IDEC Pharmaceuticals: The Birthplace

### A Southern California Biotech Story

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, **IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation** in San Diego was working on monoclonal antibody therapies. The company was founded with the vision of creating therapeutic antibodies that could treat cancer.

### The Molecule Takes Shape (1991)

In **1991**, scientists at IDEC Pharmaceuticals genetically engineered what would become rituximab[^2]:

**The Design:**
- **Chimeric monoclonal antibody:** Mouse variable regions + Human constant regions[^2]
- **Target:** CD20 protein on B cells
- **Antibody class:** IgG1 kappa
- **Mechanism:** Multiple pathways to kill B cells

**The Structure:**
- 2 heavy chains (451 amino acids each)
- 2 light chains (213 amino acids each)
- Molecular weight: approximately 143,860 Daltons

### Why "Chimeric"?

Early therapeutic antibodies were fully murine (mouse-derived). The problem: patients' immune systems recognized them as foreign and developed neutralizing antibodies.

The solution: **Create a chimeric antibody** with:
- Mouse portions that recognize the target (variable regions)
- Human portions that the immune system tolerates (constant regions)

This design represented a major advance in antibody engineering.

## The Mechanism: A Triple Threat

Rituximab was designed to kill B cells through multiple mechanisms:

### 1. Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC)
Rituximab coats B cells, marking them for destruction by natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages.

### 2. Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC)
The antibody activates the complement system, creating pores in B-cell membranes that cause cell lysis.

### 3. Direct Apoptosis
Binding to CD20 can trigger programmed cell death signals directly.

This multi-pronged approach made rituximab particularly effective at depleting B cells.

## The Development Race

### Clinical Trials (1993-1996)

**Phase I:** March 1993 - First humans treated[^3]
- Dose escalation studies
- Safety evaluation
- First evidence of efficacy in lymphoma patients

**Phase II:** Refined dosing and patient selection[^3]
- 166 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade NHL
- Demonstrated clear responses

**Phase III:** Completed March 1996[^3]
- Confirmed efficacy in larger patient population
- Established safety profile

### The Genentech Partnership (1995)

In March 1995, IDEC entered into a crucial collaboration[^4]:

**IDEC Pharmaceuticals** + **Genentech, Inc.** + **F. Hoffmann-La Roche**

This partnership provided:
- Manufacturing expertise
- Global distribution capabilities
- Regulatory experience
- Financial resources

It would prove essential to rituximab's success—and to its eventual journey into autoimmune disease.

## FDA Approval: November 26, 1997

### A Historic Moment

On November 26, 1997, the FDA approved **Rituxan (rituximab)**[^5] for:

**"Treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, CD20-positive, B-cell, low-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"**[^5]

### Why This Mattered

Rituximab was the **first monoclonal antibody approved specifically for cancer treatment.**[^5]

Previous mAbs had been approved for other indications, but rituximab proved that antibody therapy could effectively treat malignancy. This opened the floodgates for a new era of cancer immunotherapy.

### The Approval in Europe

**June 2, 1998:** European Union approval (marketed as **MabThera**)[^6]

Rituximab was now a global drug.

## The Original Vision: Killing Cancer Cells

### What IDEC Intended

Rituximab was designed with a clear purpose:

**Destroy malignant B cells in patients with lymphoma.**

The logic was straightforward:
1. Lymphomas are cancers of B cells
2. Most lymphomas express CD20
3. Deplete CD20+ cells, including the cancerous ones
4. Stem cells survive and eventually regenerate healthy B cells

It worked brilliantly.

### Early Success Metrics

By the late 1990s, rituximab demonstrated[^7]:

- **Overall response rates:** 48% in relapsed/refractory NHL
- **Complete responses:** In 6-10% of patients
- **Durable responses:** Some lasting years
- **Generally well-tolerated:** Infusion reactions manageable

For patients with limited options, rituximab was transformative.

## What No One Expected

### The Serendipitous Question

As rituximab proved successful in cancer, some researchers began asking a provocative question:

**"If rituximab can deplete normal B cells as a side effect in cancer patients, what would happen if we used it in diseases caused by abnormal B-cell activity?"**

This was not the original plan. But in medicine, as in life, some of the best discoveries come from asking unexpected questions.

Rheumatoid arthritis would be first. Multiple sclerosis would follow. And the biggest surprise? Neither was initially considered a B-cell disease.
