# Rituximab for Multiple Sclerosis: Dossier Overview

## Executive Summary

Rituximab represents one of the most compelling stories of drug repurposing in modern medicine—a
cancer drug that revolutionized not one, but multiple therapeutic areas. Originally approved in 1997
for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, rituximab became the first monoclonal antibody approved for cancer
treatment and went on to demonstrate transformative potential in autoimmune diseases, particularly
multiple sclerosis.

## The Journey at a Glance

**Original Indication:** Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (1997) **Repurposed For:** Rheumatoid Arthritis
(2006), Multiple Sclerosis (off-label, ~2008 onwards) **Key Milestone:** Led to development of
ocrelizumab, the first FDA-approved treatment for primary progressive MS (2017)

## Why This Story Matters

Rituximab's journey to MS represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of autoimmune disease.
For decades, multiple sclerosis was considered purely a T-cell disease. Rituximab's success proved
that B cells play a critical role, opening an entirely new therapeutic avenue that has transformed
patient outcomes.

This drug's story encompasses:

-   A fundamental scientific discovery about CD20+ B cells in the 1980s
-   Rapid development and approval for lymphoma in the 1990s
-   An unexpected pivot to rheumatoid arthritis that shocked the immunology community
-   Off-label use in MS that revealed profound efficacy
-   Peak sales exceeding $7-9 billion annually
-   Direct inspiration for next-generation therapies like ocrelizumab

## The Human Impact

Rituximab and its descendants have given hope to patients with previously untreatable forms of MS,
particularly primary progressive disease. By targeting B cells, these therapies can significantly
reduce relapses, slow disability progression, and for many patients, achieve "no evidence of disease
activity" (NEDA) status—something that seemed impossible in the interferon era.

## Document Structure

This dossier is organized into seven sections that tell the complete story:
