# Cold Open: The Cancer Drug That Rewrote MS

ELENA: [energetic] Welcome to The Pivot, the show where we tell the stories of drugs that changed medicine—but not in the way anyone expected. I'm Elena Cross.

MARCUS: [enthusiastic] And I'm Dr. Marcus Hale. Today we're covering what might be one of the most important drug repurposing stories in modern medicine.

ELENA: [intrigued] In 1997, the FDA approved rituximab—a drug designed to kill cancerous B cells in lymphoma patients. It would go on to become one of the best-selling drugs in history, generating over a hundred billion dollars in revenue.

MARCUS: [passionate] But here's where it gets really interesting. Within a decade, this cancer drug would accidentally overturn fifty years of scientific consensus about multiple sclerosis.

ELENA: [amazed] We're talking about a complete paradigm shift. Every textbook, every researcher, every clinical trial said MS was caused by one type of immune cell—T cells.

MARCUS: [serious] Rituximab revealed they were all wrong. The real culprits were B cells—a completely different part of the immune system that neurologists had dismissed for decades.

ELENA: [emotional] And the impact? This discovery transformed MS from a disease of inevitable disability into a manageable condition. It gave hundreds of thousands of patients something they'd never had before.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Hope for a life without relapses.

ELENA: [excited] So buckle up, because this is the story of how one researcher had the courage to challenge everything the field believed—and changed medicine forever. This is "The Cancer Drug That Rewrote MS."
