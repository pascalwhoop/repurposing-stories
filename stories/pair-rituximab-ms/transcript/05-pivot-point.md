# Chapter 4: The Commercial Chess Game (55:00-75:00)

ELENA: [energetic] Welcome back to The Pivot. We just covered Stephen Hauser's breakthrough trial—ninety-one percent reduction in MRI lesions. Swedish doctors prescribing it off-label with incredible real-world results. So the obvious question is: Why didn't rituximab get FDA approval for MS?

MARCUS: [analytical] This is where we need to talk about patent cliffs and pharmaceutical economics. I dug into the patent timeline for rituximab, and here's what I found.

ELENA: [intrigued] What was the situation?

MARCUS: [serious] The core patents on rituximab were expiring between 2013 and 2016. By the time Hauser's 2008 trial was published, Roche—which had acquired the rights to rituximab—was looking at maybe five to seven years of patent exclusivity left.

ELENA: [thoughtful] And getting FDA approval for a new indication requires Phase III trials. Those are massive, expensive, and slow.

MARCUS: [passionate] Exactly. A typical Phase III program for MS would cost 300 to 500 million dollars and take four to six years to complete. So you'd spend half a billion dollars, finish your trials in 2013 or 2014, and right as you get approval, generic competitors enter the market.

ELENA: [skeptical] So the business case doesn't work. You're making a massive investment right as your patent protection evaporates.

MARCUS: [reflective] That's the calculus Roche was facing. And they made a decision that was both commercially rational and clinically controversial.

ELENA: [curious] What did they do?

MARCUS: [analytical] They developed ocrelizumab. It's a fully humanized anti-CD20 antibody—remember, rituximab was chimeric, part mouse, part human. Ocrelizumab is engineered to be entirely human protein.

ELENA: [impressed] Which means better tolerability, potentially less immunogenicity.

MARCUS: [enthusiastic] Right. And critically, ocrelizumab had patents extending into the 2030s. So Roche bet on the next-generation molecule where they'd have long-term exclusivity.

ELENA: [intrigued] Walk me through the clinical trial program. What did they need to prove?

MARCUS: [excited] They launched two parallel trials for relapsing MS—OPERA I and OPERA II. Each trial enrolled about 800 patients, comparing ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a.

ELENA: [fascinated] And for primary progressive MS?

MARCUS: [passionate] That's the ORATORIO trial. This is the one that would make history, because remember—nothing had ever worked for primary progressive MS.

ELENA: [amazed] How did they design that trial?

MARCUS: [analytical] They enrolled 732 patients with PPMS, randomized to ocrelizumab or placebo. The primary endpoint was disability progression confirmed at twelve weeks.

ELENA: [tense] So they're asking: Can you slow the inevitable decline?

MARCUS: [serious] Exactly. And the results, published in 2017, showed a modest but significant benefit. Ocrelizumab reduced the risk of disability progression by about 24 percent.

ELENA: [thoughtful] Twenty-four percent doesn't sound like the ninety-one percent reduction we saw in relapsing MS.

MARCUS: [reflective] It's not. But Elena, this is primary progressive MS—a disease where nothing had ever shown a benefit. Patients and doctors weren't looking for a cure—they were desperate for anything that could slow the decline.

ELENA: [emotional] So even modest efficacy was revolutionary.

MARCUS: [impressed] March 28, 2017: The FDA approves ocrelizumab for both relapsing MS and primary progressive MS. First drug ever approved for PPMS.

ELENA: [excited] And the commercial launch?

MARCUS: [enthusiastic] Blockbuster from day one. First-year sales: 1.3 billion dollars. By 2025, cumulative revenue exceeded 35 billion dollars.

ELENA: [amazed] That's an incredible success.

MARCUS: [passionate] And from a drug development perspective, Roche's bet paid off. They invested in rigorous trials, proved efficacy in both relapsing and progressive MS, and built a product that would have patent protection for decades.

ELENA: [skeptical] But Marcus, here's the tension I want to explore. While Roche was running trials for ocrelizumab, what was happening with rituximab?

MARCUS: [intrigued] Oh, this is the fascinating part. Rituximab thrived as an off-label treatment.

ELENA: [curious] Even without MS approval?

MARCUS: [impressed] Neurologists read the Hauser trial, saw the Swedish real-world data, and started prescribing rituximab for MS based on clinical judgment. It became standard practice in many centers.

ELENA: [thoughtful] And then biosimilars entered the market when the patents expired. I looked at the pricing data—biosimilar rituximab was launching at 40 to 60 percent discounts compared to the original.

MARCUS: [analytical] So you had this interesting dynamic. Ocrelizumab had FDA approval, but rituximab biosimilars were significantly cheaper and had years of real-world evidence in MS.

ELENA: [fascinated] Did comparative effectiveness studies get done? Do we know if ocrelizumab is actually better than rituximab?

MARCUS: [reflective] This is where the evidence gets really interesting. Multiple studies compared the two drugs in real-world settings—observational cohorts, registry data.

ELENA: [intrigued] And what did they find?

MARCUS: [serious] The efficacy is essentially equivalent. Similar relapse rate reductions, similar disability outcomes, similar MRI lesion control.

ELENA: [surprised] So clinically, they're performing the same?

MARCUS: [thoughtful] In head-to-head comparisons, yes. Now, ocrelizumab has a theoretical advantage—being fully humanized might reduce immunogenicity. But in practice, the efficacy difference is marginal.

ELENA: [passionate] Which raises a profound question about the value of the FDA approval process. Roche spent probably a billion dollars on the ocrelizumab development program. They proved it works. But rituximab, which was never formally tested in Phase III MS trials, performs just as well in real-world use.

MARCUS: [analytical] And this gets to one of our mental models: the Off-Label Validation Loop. Strong Phase II data plus extensive real-world evidence created clinical confidence even without formal approval.

ELENA: [intrigued] But there are downsides to the off-label approach, right? Insurance coverage issues?

MARCUS: [serious] Absolutely. If a drug doesn't have FDA approval for an indication, insurers can refuse to cover it. So some patients who would benefit from rituximab couldn't access it, or had to go through lengthy appeals processes.

ELENA: [concerned] While ocrelizumab, with its FDA approval, was covered automatically but cost significantly more.

MARCUS: [reflective] It's a complex trade-off. The FDA approval provides regulatory certainty and insurance coverage, but it requires massive investment that only makes sense with patent protection.

ELENA: [thoughtful] And this creates global equity issues. Let's talk about what happened in different countries.

MARCUS: [passionate] In the US and Europe, patients mostly got ocrelizumab after 2017. It was FDA-approved, guidelines recommended it, insurers covered it. In middle-income countries—places where the per-capita healthcare budget couldn't support $65,000-per-year treatments—rituximab biosimilars became the standard.

ELENA: [somber] And in low-income countries?

MARCUS: [serious] Many patients had no access to either drug. Even biosimilar rituximab was too expensive, and the infrastructure for infusion therapy wasn't available.

ELENA: [emotional] So the repurposing success story has geographic boundaries. If you live in a wealthy country, you have access to transformative treatment. If you don't, you might still be in the interferon era—or worse, no treatment at all.

MARCUS: [reflective] This is why, when we grade rituximab's repurposing for MS, we can't give it a perfect score on the Commercial Viability dimension. The financial success is undeniable—over $135 billion when you combine rituximab across all indications and ocrelizumab. But access equity remains a problem.

ELENA: [thoughtful] Although, to be fair, biosimilar rituximab does provide a lower-cost option in places where it's available.

MARCUS: [analytical] True. And that's better than the alternative where only a single high-priced option exists. Competition and off-label use did expand access compared to a scenario where ocrelizumab was the only option.

ELENA: [intrigued] I want to talk about the business strategy from Roche's perspective. Was developing ocrelizumab instead of pursuing rituximab approval the right decision?

MARCUS: [passionate] From a shareholder value perspective? Absolutely. They created a product with decades of patent life, invested in trials that proved it works, and built a multibillion-dollar franchise.

ELENA: [skeptical] But from a societal perspective?

MARCUS: [reflective] That's more complicated. On one hand, Roche's investment gave us rigorous Phase III data, proved that B-cell depletion works for primary progressive MS—which rituximab had never been tested for—and provided regulatory certainty.

ELENA: [thoughtful] On the other hand, if Roche had pursued rituximab approval despite the patent cliff, we might have had an approved, low-cost option available globally much sooner.

MARCUS: [serious] But here's the counterfactual question: Would Roche have invested in the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS if they didn't have patent protection? Probably not.

ELENA: [impressed] So we might never have gotten the PPMS approval, which was genuinely groundbreaking.

MARCUS: [analytical] Right. The patent system creates incentives for innovation, but it also creates these tensions around access. It's not a perfect system—it's a system with trade-offs.

ELENA: [passionate] And I think that's the honest take. We don't need to villainize Roche for making a commercially rational decision, but we also can't ignore the access disparities it created.

MARCUS: [reflective] Agreed. It's nuanced reality, not a morality play.

ELENA: [enthusiastic] Alright, we've covered the business chess game. Now let's talk about impact. What happened to MS treatment after B-cell depletion became available? How did this change the standard of care?

MARCUS: [excited] This is where we see the full ripple effect. Rituximab and ocrelizumab didn't just help patients—they transformed how neurologists think about MS, how they treat it, and what outcomes they expect.

ELENA: [energetic] Let's take a break, and then we'll wrap up with the new standard of care, the innovation cascade, and why this repurposing story earns an A+ grade.

MARCUS: [delighted] The final chapter. Stay with us.
