3. **Speaker Balance**: Marcus ~52%, Elena ~48%; both voices strong and collaborative
4. **Dialogue Quality**: Conversational, natural, with genuine questions and emotional reactions
5. **Chapter Arcs**: Each chapter has tension → insight → resolution
6. **Thematic Threading**: Five core themes woven throughout without being heavy-handed
7. **Accessibility**: Complex science explained clearly; no jargon without context
8. **Respect**: Patients honored, researchers credited, hope-forward framing
