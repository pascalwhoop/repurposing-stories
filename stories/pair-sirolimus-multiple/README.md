## 📖 KEY STORYLINES

### Storyline 1: The Molecule's Journey
Easter Island discovery → near-abandonment → FDA approval for transplants → unexpected repurposing opportunities → multiple indications → ongoing expansion

### Storyline 2: The Science Reveals Itself
Observation of unexpected benefits → hypothesis of common mechanism → mTOR pathway discovery → recognition of dysregulation in multiple diseases → rational repurposing becomes possible

### Storyline 3: Patients as Heroes
TSC families fighting for research → LAM patient communities advocating → pediatric cases sparking off-label use → David Fajgenbaum decoding his own disease → patient power transforms medicine

### Storyline 4: Precision Medicine Realized
Understanding genetic defect (TSC1/TSC2 loss) → identifying pathway (mTOR dysregulation) → targeting rationally (sirolimus) → four FDA approvals → proof-of-concept for precision medicine era

### Storyline 5: The Ever-Expanding Horizon
Transplants → rare genetic diseases → vascular anomalies → cancer → Castleman's disease → aging → autoimmunity → Long COVID → "what else?"

## 💡 UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THIS EPISODE

1. **David Fajgenbaum Integration**: Unlike typical drug repurposing stories, this centers patient power—a medical student teaching himself genomics to decode his own disease and discover a treatment

2. **mTOR as Unifying Principle**: Rather than jumping between unrelated indications, the episode uses molecular mechanism as the connective tissue, helping listeners understand WHY one drug works across so many diseases

3. **Multiple Patient Perspectives**: TSC families, LAM patients, pediatric cases, Castleman's disease advocate—diverse voices and experiences

4. **Researcher Dedication Honored**: Sehgal's persistence, Franz's EXIST trials, McCormack's MILES trial, Kaeberlein's aging research—scientists portrayed as passionate advocates for patients

5. **Hope Without Overpromising**: Emerging applications (Long COVID, aging, autoimmunity) presented as promising early research, not as cures

6. **Scientific Rigor + Human Heart**: Balances detailed clinical data with compelling patient stories; neither overwhelming nor saccharine

- Patient stories: Intimate, conversational tone
- Closing: Return to oceanic sounds for narrative closure

### Pacing Notes
- Chapters 01-03: Slower, more narrative-driven (~4 min each)
- Chapters 04-07: Medium pace; balance technical detail with patient impact
- Chapter 08 (Fajgenbaum): Build energy toward climax
