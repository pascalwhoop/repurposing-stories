# Discovery of Sirolimus and Path to Immunosuppression

The story of sirolimus begins not in a laboratory, but on one of the most remote islands on Earth—a place of mystery, giant stone statues, and hidden microbial treasures.

## 1. The Easter Island Expedition (1964-1972)

In 1964, Montreal bacteriologist Georges Nógrády embarked on a Canadian medical expedition to Easter Island (Rapa Nui), collecting soil samples as part of a broader investigation into the island's unique microbiology. The original hypothesis was that antibacterial compounds in the soil might explain why the natives of Easter Island had a low incidence of tetanus despite commonly walking barefoot.

These soil samples were shipped to Ayerst Laboratories in Montreal, Canada, where scientist Dr. Surendra Nath Sehgal (known as Suren Sehgal) began the painstaking work of isolating microorganisms and screening them for biological activity. After years of culturing and testing, one bacterium stood out: *Streptomyces hygroscopicus* (strain AY B-994), which produced a compound with potent antifungal properties. [Source: Wikipedia - Surendra Nath Sehgal]

The compound inhibited *Candida albicans*, *Microsporum gypseum*, and *Trichophyton granulosum*. In homage to the Polynesian name for Easter Island—Rapa Nui—the team named the new molecule rapamycin in 1972. [PMID: 1102508; Vézina et al. 1975, J Antibiot]

## 2. The Near-Death of Rapamycin (1975-1987)

Sehgal quickly discovered that rapamycin had more than antifungal activity—it also showed antiproliferative effects. He sent samples to the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI), where screening revealed impressive activity against solid tumors, quickly gaining "priority status" for further investigation.

However, rapamycin's early promise was almost extinguished by corporate consolidation. In 1983, Ayerst Laboratories closed its Montreal research facility as part of a workforce consolidation, and the rapamycin program was cancelled. Scientists were instructed to destroy all biological samples not actively in use.

But Sehgal refused to let rapamycin die. In an act of scientific defiance, he secretly took vials of the rapamycin-producing *S. hygroscopicus* bacteria home and stored them in his personal freezer—next to the ice cream, in a package labeled "DON'T EAT!" He transported the vials in a homemade dry-ice cooler when he relocated to Princeton, New Jersey. [Source: Business Insider 2015; C&EN 2016; Wikipedia]

## 3. Resurrection and the Discovery of Immunosuppression (1987-1999)

When Ayerst was acquired by Wyeth in 1987, Sehgal convinced his new management to officially resume work on rapamycin. This decision would prove transformative. [Source: Business Insider 2015]

During renewed investigations, researchers discovered that rapamycin was not only antifungal and anti-proliferative, but also a potent immunosuppressant. It inhibited T-cell activation and proliferation through a previously unknown mechanism—distinct from all other immunosuppressants available at the time.

The mechanism was eventually elucidated: rapamycin binds to an intracellular protein called FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12). This rapamycin-FKBP12 complex then binds to and inhibits a protein kinase later named "mammalian target of rapamycin" (mTOR), which plays a fundamental role in regulating cell growth, metabolism, and immune cell proliferation. [Source: Britannica - Rapamycin]

Recognizing its immunosuppressive potential, Wyeth pursued rapamycin as a treatment for organ transplant rejection. Clinical trials demonstrated its efficacy in preventing rejection in kidney transplant patients, with reduced incidence of acute rejection episodes even with lower doses of concomitant cyclosporine. [PMID: 10589952; Kahan et al. Transplantation 1999]

On September 15, 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sirolimus (marketed as RAPAMUNE) for the prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplant recipients. [Source: Spice.alibaba.com; cureibm.org]

## 4. The Death of a Pioneer

Tragically, Suren Sehgal did not live long enough to witness the full impact of his discovery. He died on January 21, 2003, just four years after FDA approval. [Source: Kahan BD. Transplantation 2003; 76:623-624]

Had Sehgal obeyed his bosses in 1983 and destroyed those bacterial cultures, rapamycin would have been lost to history. Instead, his conviction that this compound held untapped potential led to one of the most versatile drugs in modern medicine—a compound that would eventually extend far beyond transplantation into rare diseases, cancer, and potentially aging itself.

## 5. From Single Indication to Multi-Disease Wonder Drug

The FDA approval in 1999 marked only the beginning. Over the following two decades, researchers discovered that mTOR inhibition—the core mechanism of rapamycin—was relevant to an astonishingly diverse array of diseases:

- **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)**: A genetic disease where mTOR is constitutively hyperactivated due to mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes
- **Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)**: A rare lung disease affecting primarily women, with abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells
- **Vascular Anomalies**: Including kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and complex hemangiomas
- **Cancer**: Particularly perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComa), renal cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumors
- **Aging**: Rapamycin is the only drug proven to extend lifespan in every tested organism from yeast to mice

This remarkable versatility stems from mTOR's central role as a "master regulator" of cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. When mTOR signaling is dysregulated—whether by genetic mutations, environmental triggers, or aging—sirolimus offers a way to reset the balance.
