# Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: The Pivotal FDA Approvals

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) represents the first major disease—beyond organ
transplantation—where sirolimus and its analogs demonstrated transformative clinical benefit. The
story of mTOR inhibitors in TSC is one of precision medicine: matching a drug's mechanism to a
disease's underlying genetic cause.

## 1. Understanding Tuberous Sclerosis Complex

### The Genetic Basis

TSC is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 6,000 to 10,000
individuals. It is caused by loss-of-function mutations in one of two tumor suppressor genes:

-   **TSC1** (chromosome 9q34): Encodes hamartin
-   **TSC2** (chromosome 16p13.3): Encodes tuberin

About 75-90% of TSC cases can be attributed to pathological mutations in these genes, with TSC2
mutations generally associated with more severe phenotypes than TSC1 mutations. [Source: Radiopaedia

### The Clinical Phenotype

TSC is characterized by the development of benign tumors (hamartomas) in multiple organs:

-   **Brain**: Cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs)
-   **Skin**: Facial angiofibromas, hypomelanotic macules, shagreen patches
-   **Kidneys**: Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs)
-   **Lungs**: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), particularly in women
-   **Heart**: Cardiac rhabdomyomas

The most devastating manifestations include:

-   **Epilepsy**: Affects over 80% of TSC patients, with infantile spasms often appearing in the
    first year of life. Epilepsy is refractory (treatment-resistant) in 32.9-62.5% of patients.
    [PMID: PMC12648938]
-   **Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder**: Present in 45-60% of patients,
    strongly linked to early-onset seizures
-   **SEGAs**: Slow-growing brain tumors near the ventricles that can cause obstructive
    hydrocephalus, requiring surgical intervention

[Source: PMC12648938]

### The mTOR Connection

The crucial mechanistic insight came from understanding that TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a complex
that negatively regulates mTOR signaling (see File 02). When either gene is mutated, this "brake" on
mTOR is lost, resulting in constitutive mTORC1 hyperactivation—driving uncontrolled cell growth and
proliferation.

> "TSC can be caused by either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, and individuals carrying the same
> disease-causing gene variant within or between families might present with a variable spectrum of
> phenotypic findings." [Source: Nature s41390-025-04611-y]

This understanding suggested a therapeutic hypothesis: pharmacological mTOR inhibition with
sirolimus or everolimus might counteract the genetic loss of TSC1/2, restoring normal growth
control.

## 2. EXIST-1: Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytomas (2010-2012)

### The Clinical Problem

SEGAs are benign brain tumors that grow near the lateral ventricles in 10-20% of TSC patients. While
histologically benign, they can cause life-threatening complications:

-   Obstructive hydrocephalus (buildup of cerebrospinal fluid)
-   Increased intracranial pressure
-   Neurological deficits

The standard treatment was neurosurgical resection, but surgery carries risks including hemorrhage,
neurological damage, and the tumors can recur. Many patients—particularly young children or those
with complex anatomy—are poor surgical candidates.

### The EXIST-1 Trial

The EXIST-1 trial (EXamining everolimus In a Study of TSC) was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study evaluating everolimus (a rapamycin analog) for SEGAs in TSC patients.

**Design:**

-   **n = 117 patients** with TSC-associated SEGAs
-   Patients randomized to everolimus or placebo
-   Primary endpoint: SEGA response rate (≥50% reduction in tumor volume)

**Results (Published 2013):**

-   **SEGA response rate**: 34.6% with everolimus vs. 0% with placebo (p<0.0001)
-   **Median time to SEGA progression**: Not reached with everolimus vs. 14.5 months with placebo
-   **Seizure frequency**: Reduction observed in everolimus group as secondary benefit

[PMID: 23158522; Franz DN et al. *Lancet* 2013]

### Two-Year Extension Results

The 2-year open-label extension study (published 2014) demonstrated:

-   **Sustained SEGA response**: 42% of patients achieved ≥50% tumor volume reduction
-   **Mean SEGA volume reduction**: 53% from baseline
-   **No patients required surgical intervention** during the extension phase
-   **Tolerability**: Manageable side effects including stomatitis, upper respiratory infections,
    and hypercholesterolemia

[PMID: 25176294; Franz DN et al. *Lancet Oncol* 2014]

### FDA Approval

Based on EXIST-1 results, the FDA approved **everolimus (Afinitor) for TSC-associated SEGAs in
2012**. This was the first FDA-approved medical therapy for a TSC-associated tumor, offering a
non-surgical option for patients with growing or symptomatic SEGAs. [PMID: 23158522; FDA approval
data, 2012]

## 3. EXIST-2: Renal Angiomyolipomas (2012-2013)

### The Clinical Problem

Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs)—benign tumors composed of blood vessels, smooth muscle, and fat—occur
in 80% of TSC patients. While benign, large AMLs (>3-4 cm) carry risk of:

-   **Spontaneous hemorrhage**: Life-threatening retroperitoneal bleeding
-   **Chronic kidney disease**: From tumor mass effect and hemorrhage
-   **Need for invasive intervention**: Embolization or nephrectomy

Before mTOR inhibitors, management options were limited to surveillance or interventional
procedures, with high recurrence rates.

### The EXIST-2 Trial

EXIST-2 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of everolimus for
TSC-associated renal AMLs.

**Design:**

-   **n = 118 patients** with TSC-associated renal AMLs ≥3 cm
-   Randomized to everolimus 10 mg/day or placebo
-   Primary endpoint: AML response rate (≥50% reduction in total AML volume)

**Results (Published 2013):**

-   **AML response rate**: 41.8% with everolimus vs. 0% with placebo (p<0.0001)
-   **Median time to AML progression**: Not reached with everolimus vs. 11.4 months with placebo
-   **Skin lesion improvement**: 42% of everolimus patients had ≥50% reduction in facial
    angiofibromas (vs. 11% placebo)

[PMID: 23158854; Bissler JJ et al. *Lancet* 2013]

### Long-Term Extension Data

A subsequent analysis of long-term extension data (published 2016) demonstrated:

-   **Sustained AML response**: Maintained over 3-4 years of treatment
-   **Renal function preservation**: Stable or improved kidney function
-   **Reduced need for invasive procedures**: Dramatic decrease in embolizations and surgeries

[Source: ADC BMJ Franz study; PMC12594532]

### FDA Approval

The FDA approved **everolimus for TSC-associated renal AMLs not requiring immediate surgery in
2012**. This transformed AML management from reactive (wait for hemorrhage) to proactive medical
therapy. [PMID: 23158854; FDA approval data, 2012]

## 4. EXIST-3: Treatment-Resistant Epilepsy (2016-2018)

### The Clinical Problem

Epilepsy is the most common and often most devastating neurological manifestation of TSC. Key
challenges include:

-   **Early onset**: Infantile spasms often appear in first year of life
-   **Drug resistance**: 32.9-62.5% of TSC epilepsy is refractory to antiseizure medications (ASMs)
-   **Neurodevelopmental impact**: Early-onset, uncontrolled seizures strongly predict intellectual
    disability and autism

> "Seizures experienced by these patients typically develop in the first few years of life and have
> an associated risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and cognitive impairment, making early
> recognition and diagnosis of seizures and effective disease management essential." [Source:
> PMC12648938]

Before EXIST-3, there were no FDA-approved therapies specifically for TSC-associated epilepsy—only
general ASMs with limited efficacy in this population.

### The EXIST-3 Trial

EXIST-3 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive everolimus
for treatment-resistant focal-onset seizures in TSC.

**Design:**

-   **n = 366 patients** (age 2-65 years) with TSC and refractory partial-onset seizures
-   Randomized to everolimus (low or high exposure) or placebo
-   Primary endpoint: Percentage reduction in seizure frequency from baseline

**Results (Published 2016 in _The Lancet_):**

-   **Median seizure frequency reduction**:
    -   Low-exposure everolimus: 29.3%
    -   High-exposure everolimus: 39.6%
    -   Placebo: 14.9%
    -   (Both everolimus arms superior to placebo, p<0.01)
-   **≥50% responder rate** (patients with ≥50% reduction in seizures):
    -   High-exposure: 40%
    -   Low-exposure: 28.2%
    -   Placebo: 15.1%

[PMID: 27477500; French JA et al. *Lancet* 2016; 388(10056):2153-2163]

### Cognitive and Quality-of-Life Benefits

A post-hoc analysis of EXIST-3 data revealed improvements beyond seizure control:

-   **Executive function**: Improved attention, concentration, and language skills
-   **Behavioral outcomes**: Reduced hyperactivity and emotional difficulties
-   **Quality of life**: Significant improvements in child and parent-reported QOL scores

These findings suggest that early seizure control with everolimus may mitigate neurodevelopmental
consequences of TSC epilepsy. [Source: PMC12648938]

### FDA Approval

In April 2018, the FDA approved **everolimus (Afinitor) as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset
seizures associated with TSC in patients ≥2 years old**. [PMID: 27477500; FDA approval data, 2018]

Everolimus and cannabidiol remain the **only two therapies approved specifically for TSC-associated
seizures** (as opposed to epilepsy in general). [Source: PMC12648938]

## 5. Sirolimus for LAM (2011-2012)

While not exclusively a TSC manifestation, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)—a progressive lung
disease—occurs in 30-40% of women with TSC. The landmark MILES trial (discussed in File 04)
demonstrated sirolimus efficacy for LAM, and the FDA approved **sirolimus (Rapamune) for LAM in
2015**. [Source: ADC BMJ study]

## 6. Topical Sirolimus for Facial Angiofibromas (2018)

Facial angiofibromas are disfiguring skin lesions affecting 75% of TSC patients. A 2018 randomized
controlled trial by Wataya-Kaneda et al. demonstrated that **topical sirolimus gel** significantly
reduced facial angiofibroma lesion volume compared to placebo.

**Results:**

-   **Primary endpoint (angiofibroma volume reduction)**: Significant improvement with sirolimus vs.
    placebo (p<0.001)
-   **Secondary endpoints**: Improved appearance, reduced redness, improved patient-reported
    outcomes

[PMID: 29896623; Wataya-Kaneda M et al. *JAMA Dermatol* 2018; 154(7):781-788]

This led to broader use of topical sirolimus formulations for TSC skin lesions, though not formally
FDA-approved as a separate indication.

## 7. The Paradigm Shift: From Symptom Management to Precision Medicine

The EXIST trials and related studies fundamentally transformed TSC care:

### Before mTOR Inhibitors:

-   **Reactive symptom management**: Surgery for SEGAs, embolization for AMLs, multiple ASMs for
    seizures
-   **High morbidity**: Repeated invasive procedures, neurological complications
-   **Progressive decline**: No way to halt underlying disease progression

### After mTOR Inhibitors:

-   **Proactive molecular therapy**: Directly targeting the genetic defect's downstream consequence
    (mTOR hyperactivation)
-   **Multi-organ benefit**: Single drug addresses brain, kidney, lung, and skin manifestations
-   **Improved outcomes**: Preserved organ function, better seizure control, enhanced quality of
    life

> "mTOR inhibitors, such as everolimus (FDA-approved in 2010 for subependymal giant cell
> astrocytomas and 2012 for renal angiomyolipomas), effectively reduce lesion volume by 50% or more
> in many patients, alleviating seizure frequency and tumor-related risks without surgical
> intervention." [PMID: 23158522, 23158854]

TSC became a **model for precision medicine in rare genetic diseases**: understanding the molecular
pathway (TSC1/2 → mTOR) enabled rational drug repurposing (sirolimus/everolimus), confirmed by
rigorous clinical trials, leading to multiple FDA approvals and transformed patient outcomes.
