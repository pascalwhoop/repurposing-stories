# Rare Lung Diseases: LAM, PAH, and BOS

Sirolimus's repurposing journey extended from solid tumors to some of the most devastating and
untreatable lung diseases—conditions where patients faced inexorable decline toward respiratory
failure and lung transplantation. These pulmonary applications represent triumph stories in rare
disease research.

## 1. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM): The MILES Trial

### The Disease

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, progressive lung disease that almost exclusively affects
women of childbearing age, with an estimated prevalence of 3-5 per million. LAM is characterized by:

-   **Abnormal smooth muscle-like cell (LAM cell) proliferation** throughout the lungs
-   **Cystic destruction of lung parenchyma** leading to progressive respiratory failure
-   **Obstruction of lymphatic vessels** causing chylous effusions (lymphatic fluid in chest cavity)
-   **Increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax** (collapsed lung)

LAM occurs in two forms:

-   **Sporadic LAM** (~60-70% of cases): No family history or TSC
-   **TSC-associated LAM** (~30-40%): Occurs in women with tuberous sclerosis complex

Remarkably, both forms share TSC2 gene mutations in LAM cells, suggesting a common pathogenic
mechanism involving mTOR hyperactivation. [Source: Radiopaedia LAM; PMC12594532]

### The Clinical Crisis

Before 2011, there was no effective medical therapy for LAM. Median survival from diagnosis was
approximately 8-10 years, with most patients progressing to:

-   Chronic hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen
-   Severe dyspnea limiting daily activities
-   Lung transplantation (the only definitive treatment)
-   Death from respiratory failure

> have been shown to benefit patients with LAM, with mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus or everolimus)
> being one of the main treatment options." [Source: Radiopaedia LAM]

### The MILES Trial: A Landmark Study

The **MILES trial** (Multicenter International Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Efficacy of Sirolimus) was a
phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study led by Dr. Francis X. McCormack at the
University of Cincinnati.

**Design:**

-   **n = 89 patients** with LAM and evidence of declining lung function
-   Randomized to sirolimus or placebo for 12 months
-   Primary endpoint: Change in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) from baseline
-   Secondary endpoints: Quality of life, functional capacity (6-minute walk test), serum VEGF-D
    levels

**Results (Published 2011 in _New England Journal of Medicine_):**

-   **FEV1 stabilization**: Sirolimus group had mean increase of 1 mL FEV1 vs. decline of -12 mL in
    placebo (p=0.03)
-   **Quality of life**: Significant improvements in SGRQ (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire)
    scores
-   **Functional capacity**: Improved 6-minute walk distance in sirolimus group
-   **Adverse events**: Manageable, including mouth sores, diarrhea, acne, and hyperlipidemia
-   **Serum VEGF-D**: Decreased significantly with sirolimus treatment, correlating with clinical
    response

[PMID: 21410393; McCormack FP et al. *N Engl J Med* 2011; 364:1595-1606]

### Post-Study Continuation and Long-Term Data

A critical finding emerged when the trial ended: patients who stopped sirolimus experienced lung
function decline, while those who continued (via open-label extension) maintained stable lung
function. This demonstrated:

-   **Disease-modifying effect**: Sirolimus stabilizes LAM but doesn't cure it—benefit requires
    continued therapy
-   **Reversibility of benefit**: Stopping treatment leads to resumed disease progression
-   **Long-term tolerability**: Patients maintained on sirolimus for years showed acceptable safety
    profiles

### VEGF-D as a Biomarker

The MILES trial also validated **serum VEGF-D** as a disease biomarker for LAM. Elevated VEGF-D
(>800 pg/mL) has:

-   **High specificity (>95%)** for LAM diagnosis
-   **Correlation with disease severity** and lung function decline
-   **Response prediction**: Decreases with sirolimus treatment correlate with clinical benefit

[PMID: 23706472; Young L et al. *Lancet Respir Med* 2013; 1(6):445-52]

This discovery provided a non-invasive tool for diagnosis and treatment monitoring, particularly
valuable given LAM's rarity.

### FDA Approval and Clinical Impact

Based on MILES trial results, in **May 2015**, the FDA approved **sirolimus (Rapamune) for the
treatment of LAM**. This was a transformative moment:

-   First and only FDA-approved therapy for LAM
-   Shifted treatment paradigm from "watchful waiting" to proactive therapy
-   Reduced need for lung transplantation in many patients
-   Improved quality of life and functional capacity

### Updated Clinical Guidelines

Subsequent research from the MILES trial led to revised treatment recommendations. Initially,
guidelines suggested starting sirolimus only after documented lung function decline. However, later
analysis showed benefit regardless of baseline lung function severity, leading to updated 2016
ATS/JRS guidelines:

> "For patients with LAM and abnormal or declining lung function, treat with sirolimus rather than
> observation; this is a strong recommendation." [Source: DrOracle.ai LAM Management; PMID:

## 2. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) and mTOR

### Rationale for Investigation

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by abnormal proliferation and remodeling of
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right
heart failure. Since mTOR drives cell proliferation, investigators hypothesized that mTOR inhibition
might attenuate PAH progression.

### Preclinical Evidence

Animal studies demonstrated:

-   Reduced pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation with rapamycin
-   Attenuation of PAH development in rodent models
-   Reversal of established pulmonary vascular remodeling

### Clinical Investigation

**AI Therapeutics** has developed **LAM-001**—a novel inhaled formulation of sirolimus specifically
designed for pulmonary delivery—to minimize systemic exposure and associated toxicities while
maximizing lung tissue concentrations.

**LAM-001 is currently in Phase II clinical trials** (NCT06018766) investigating safety and efficacy
in:

-   Pulmonary arterial hypertension
-   Post-lung transplant complications (see BOS section below)

[Source: JACS AI Drug Discovery; NCT06018766]

The inhaled delivery route represents an important innovation:

-   **Targeted drug delivery** to affected lung tissue
-   **Reduced systemic side effects** (mouth sores, GI upset, metabolic abnormalities)
-   **Higher local concentrations** where disease pathology occurs

### Current Status

Results from ongoing LAM-001 trials are eagerly awaited. If successful, this would represent:

-   A new treatment modality for PAH (complementing current prostacyclin/endothelin/PDE5i therapies)
-   Validation of inhaled mTOR inhibitor delivery
-   Potential for use in other proliferative lung diseases

## 3. Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) After Lung Transplant

### The Clinical Problem

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a form of chronic lung allograft dysfunction—the leading
cause of death after lung transplantation. BOS is characterized by:

-   **Progressive airflow obstruction** (≥20% decline in FEV1 from post-transplant baseline)
-   **Fibrotic obliteration of small airways** due to chronic inflammation and remodeling
-   **Insidious onset**: Often asymptomatic until significant lung function loss
-   **Poor prognosis**: Median survival ~3-5 years after BOS diagnosis

BOS affects 50% of lung transplant recipients within 5 years, dramatically limiting long-term
transplant success. [Source: Amboss Transplantation]

### Immunologic Basis and mTOR Connection

BOS pathogenesis involves:

-   **Chronic alloimmune injury**: Low-grade T-cell and B-cell responses to donor antigens
-   **Epithelial damage and aberrant repair**: Recurrent injury → fibroproliferation
-   **Airway remodeling**: Excessive collagen deposition obliterating airway lumens

Since conventional calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) immunosuppression often fails to prevent BOS, and
mTOR inhibitors have distinct mechanisms (inhibiting both immune activation AND fibroproliferation),
sirolimus/everolimus emerged as potential BOS treatments.

### Clinical Evidence

#### Conversion Studies

Multiple observational studies have evaluated converting lung transplant patients from CNI-based to
sirolimus-based immunosuppression after BOS diagnosis:

-   **Stabilization of lung function decline**: Some patients showed slowed FEV1 decline
-   **Histologic improvement**: Reduced inflammation in transbronchial biopsies
-   **Variable response**: ~30-40% of patients benefited, others progressed despite conversion

#### Prophylactic Use

Some centers have investigated using mTOR inhibitors as primary immunosuppression post-transplant to
prevent BOS:

-   **Mixed results**: Some studies showed reduced BOS incidence, others showed no benefit
-   **Safety concerns**: Sirolimus/everolimus associated with impaired wound healing, increasing
    risk of anastomotic complications early post-transplant

[Source: Amboss Transplantation]

### LAM-001 for BOS: A Novel Approach

Recognizing that systemic sirolimus has limitations (wound healing impairment, metabolic side
effects), **AI Therapeutics' inhaled LAM-001** is being investigated specifically for BOS
prevention/treatment post-lung transplant.

**Advantages of inhaled delivery for BOS:**

-   **High local lung tissue concentrations** to inhibit fibroproliferation in airways
-   **Minimal systemic exposure** → reduced wound healing complications
-   **Can be combined with systemic CNI immunosuppression** for synergistic effect

LAM-001 is currently in **Phase II trials** for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (NCT06018766).

If successful, this could transform lung transplant outcomes by addressing the single greatest
barrier to long-term survival.

## 4. Common Themes Across Pulmonary Applications

Several unifying principles emerge from sirolimus's pulmonary repurposing:

### 1. Proliferative Pathology

All three conditions—LAM, PAH, and BOS—involve pathological cell proliferation:

-   LAM: Smooth muscle-like LAM cells
-   PAH: Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells
-   BOS: Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in airway walls

mTOR hyperactivation drives this uncontrolled proliferation, making mTOR inhibition mechanistically
rational.

### 2. Progressive Respiratory Failure

Without effective treatment, all three lead to:

-   Inexorable lung function decline
-   Respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen
-   Death or lung transplantation

Sirolimus offers disease stabilization, converting previously untreatable conditions into chronic
manageable diseases.

### 3. Role of Biomarkers

-   **LAM**: Serum VEGF-D correlates with disease activity and treatment response
-   **PAH**: NT-proBNP, 6-minute walk distance, and pulmonary hemodynamics guide therapy
-   **BOS**: Serial spirometry (FEV1 decline) is key monitoring tool

Biomarkers enable earlier diagnosis and objective treatment assessment in these rare,
difficult-to-study diseases.

### 4. Innovation in Drug Delivery

The development of **inhaled sirolimus (LAM-001)** represents an important evolution:

-   Addresses limitations of systemic oral therapy
-   Maximizes benefit-risk ratio by targeting drug to site of disease
-   Opens possibilities for other inhaled mTOR inhibitor applications
