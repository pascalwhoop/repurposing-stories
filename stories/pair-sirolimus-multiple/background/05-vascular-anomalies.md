# Vascular Anomalies: Hemangiomas and Complex Lesions

Beyond genetic syndromes and lung diseases, sirolimus found yet another therapeutic niche in
pediatric and adult vascular anomalies—a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormal
blood vessel or lymphatic vessel development. These conditions, once considered untreatable or
requiring disfiguring surgery, became manageable with mTOR inhibition.

## 1. Understanding Vascular Anomalies

### Classification System

The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classifies vascular anomalies
into two major categories:

**1. Vascular Tumors** (cellular proliferation):

-   Infantile hemangioma
-   Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE)
-   Tufted angioma

**2. Vascular Malformations** (structural abnormalities):

-   Lymphatic malformations (LMs)
-   Venous malformations (VMs)
-   Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)
-   Combined malformations

### The mTOR Connection

Recent genomic studies revealed that many vascular anomalies harbor somatic (non-inherited)
mutations in genes encoding components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, including:

-   **PIK3CA** (encodes p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K)
-   **AKT1**, **AKT2**, **AKT3**
-   **MTOR** itself
-   **GNA14**, **GNAQ** (upstream activators)

These gain-of-function mutations lead to constitutive mTOR activation in affected tissues, driving
excessive proliferation of vascular or lymphatic endothelial cells. This mechanistic insight made
mTOR inhibitors rational therapeutic candidates. [Source: GeneCards GNA14; Analesdepediatria.org]

## 2. Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma (KHE)

### Clinical Presentation

KHE is a rare, locally aggressive vascular tumor occurring primarily in infancy and early childhood
(annual incidence ~0.9 per 100,000 children in North America). Unlike infantile hemangiomas that
typically regress spontaneously, KHE:

-   **Does not regress**: Persists and may progress without treatment
-   **Invades surrounding tissues**: Affects skin, muscle, bone, and viscera
-   **Causes severe pain**: Often the presenting symptom
-   **High morbidity**: Can lead to limb dysfunction or organ compromise

[Source: PMC12653744 KHE Case Report]

### Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon (KMP)

The most life-threatening complication of KHE is Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon—a consumptive
coagulopathy characterized by:

-   **Profound thrombocytopenia** (platelet counts <10,000-20,000/μL)
-   **Hypofibrinogenemia** (fibrinogen <100 mg/dL)
-   **Risk of fatal hemorrhage**: Intracranial, gastrointestinal, or at tumor site

KMP occurs in 70-90% of KHE cases and carries significant mortality (~20-30%) if untreated. [Source:
Analesdepediatria.org]

### Historical Treatment Approaches

Before sirolimus, KHE/KMP treatment options were limited and often ineffective:

-   **Vincristine**: Chemotherapeutic agent, partial responses but significant toxicity
-   **Corticosteroids**: Variable efficacy, many side effects
-   **Interferon-alpha**: Effective but risk of spastic diplegia (irreversible neurological damage)
-   **Surgery**: Often impossible due to tumor extent and coagulopathy
-   **Supportive care**: Platelet/blood transfusions, rarely curative

Response rates were suboptimal, and many children suffered prolonged courses with organ dysfunction.

### Sirolimus for KHE: Breakthrough Reports

The first report of sirolimus efficacy for KHE came in 2010 when Blatt et al. published a case of
childhood KHE successfully treated with sirolimus, showing:

-   Resolution of thrombocytopenia
-   Tumor size reduction
-   Correction of coagulopathy
-   Improved pain and function

[PMID: 20589650; Blatt J et al. *Pediatr Blood Cancer* 2010; 55:1396-1398]

Subsequent case series confirmed these findings, establishing sirolimus as a first-line therapy for
KHE. A 2019 study by Wang et al. with long-term follow-up demonstrated:

-   **High response rate**: >80% of KHE patients showed clinical improvement
-   **Coagulopathy correction**: Normalization of platelets and fibrinogen within weeks to months
-   **Tumor volume reduction**: Sustained shrinkage on MRI imaging
-   **Functional improvement**: Reduced pain, improved mobility, enhanced quality of life

[Source: Analesdepediatria.org Wang study 2019]

### Current Clinical Practice

Sirolimus is now considered a **first-line medical therapy for complicated KHE**, particularly those
with KMP. Treatment protocols typically involve:

-   **Initial dose**: 0.8 mg/m² twice daily (pediatric dosing)
-   **Target trough levels**: 10-15 ng/mL
-   **Duration**: 6-24 months depending on response, some patients require longer therapy
-   **Monitoring**: Regular CBC, chemistry panels, sirolimus levels

## 3. Tufted Angioma

### Clinical Entity

Tufted angioma is a rare benign vascular tumor closely related to KHE, sharing:

-   Histopathologic similarities (spindle cell proliferation forming "tufts" or "cannonballs")
-   Risk of KMP (though lower than KHE, ~10-50% of cases)
-   Potential for local invasion and persistence

Some experts consider tufted angioma and KHE part of a disease spectrum rather than distinct
entities. [Source: PMC12653744]

### Response to Sirolimus

Tufted angiomas respond to sirolimus similarly to KHE:

-   Correction of associated coagulopathy
-   Tumor regression or stabilization
-   Symptom improvement (pain, swelling)

Combined data from KHE/tufted angioma cohorts show consistent benefit with mTOR inhibition,
supporting their shared pathophysiology. [Source: Analesdepediatria.org Liu study 2016]

## 4. Complex Lymphatic Malformations

### Clinical Challenge

Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are congenital vascular anomalies resulting from abnormal lymphatic
vessel development. Complex or multifocal LMs present management challenges:

-   **Multiple anatomic sites**: Head/neck, mediastinum, abdomen, extremities
-   **Infiltrative growth**: Involves critical structures (airways, nerves, vessels)
-   **Recurrent infections**: Cellulitis, lymphangitis
-   **Chronic complications**: Lymphatic leakage (chylothorax, ascites), skeletal
    overgrowth/osteolysis

Traditional interventions (sclerotherapy, surgery, laser) are often incomplete or impossible for
extensive lesions. [Source: Analesdepediatria.org]

### Somatic PIK3CA Mutations

Whole exome sequencing revealed that ~80% of lymphatic malformations harbor somatic activating
mutations in **PIK3CA**, most commonly:

-   **p.H1047R** (hotspot mutation)
-   **p.E542K**, **p.E545K**

These mutations lead to constitutive PI3K activation → AKT activation → mTORC1 hyperactivation in
lymphatic endothelial cells, driving abnormal proliferation and fluid secretion. [Source: GeneCards
GNA14]

### Sirolimus for Complex LMs

Multiple studies demonstrated sirolimus efficacy for complex LMs:

**Hammill et al. (2011)** - Prospective study of sirolimus in complicated vascular anomalies:

-   **n = 61 patients** with complex vascular anomalies (many with LMs)
-   **Response rate**: 85% showed clinical improvement
-   **Specific benefits**: Reduced lesion volume, decreased infections, resolved effusions
    (chylothorax/ascites)
-   **Skeletal effects**: Stabilized osteolysis in patients with gorham-stout disease (vanishing
    bone disease)

[PMID: 21536395; Hammill AM et al. *Pediatr Blood Cancer* 2011; 57:1018-1024]

### Mechanism of Benefit in LMs

Sirolimus provides multiple therapeutic effects for LMs:

1. **Antiproliferative**: Reduces lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation
2. **Anti-secretory**: Decreases lymphatic fluid production and leakage
3. **Anti-inflammatory**: Reduces inflammation that exacerbates lymphatic dysfunction
4. **Stabilizes bone**: Halts osteolysis in skeletal involvement

### Topical Sirolimus for Superficial LMs

For superficial microcystic LMs, **topical sirolimus** has shown promise:

-   Applied directly to affected skin
-   Reduces vesicle formation and lymphatic leakage
-   Improves cosmesis and comfort
-   Minimal systemic absorption → fewer side effects

[Source: Analesdepediatria.org]

## 5. Other Vascular Anomalies Responsive to Sirolimus

### Venous Malformations (VMs)

VMs with somatic PIK3CA or TEK mutations may respond to sirolimus:

-   Reduced pain and swelling
-   Decreased thrombosis and D-dimer levels
-   Improved function and quality of life

### Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome (BRBNS)

This rare condition featuring multiple venous malformations throughout skin and GI tract causes:

-   Chronic GI bleeding and anemia
-   Multiple painful cutaneous lesions

Case reports show sirolimus can reduce GI bleeding episodes and transfusion requirements.

### Gorham-Stout Disease (Vanishing Bone Disease)

This ultra-rare condition involves lymphatic proliferation within bone, causing progressive
osteolysis. Sirolimus has demonstrated:

-   Stabilization of bone loss
-   Prevention of pathologic fractures
-   Reduction of associated chylous effusions

[Source: Analesdepediatria.org]

## 6. Clinical Considerations and Challenges

### Patient Selection

Not all vascular anomalies require treatment. Sirolimus is typically reserved for:

-   **Complicated lesions**: Causing functional impairment, pain, bleeding, or disfigurement
-   **Failed conventional therapy**: Refractory to sclerotherapy, surgery, or other interventions
-   **High-risk locations**: Airway compromise, orbital involvement, spinal cord compression

### Dosing and Monitoring

Pediatric protocols typically use:

-   **Starting dose**: 0.8 mg/m² twice daily (oral solution or tablets)
-   **Target trough levels**: 10-15 ng/mL (higher than transplant dosing)
-   **Monitoring**: Monthly for first 3 months, then every 3 months
    -   Sirolimus trough levels
    -   CBC (watch for cytopenias)
    -   Lipid panel (monitor hyperlipidemia)
    -   Liver and renal function tests

### Side Effects

Common side effects in pediatric vascular anomaly patients include:

-   **Mucositis/stomatitis**: Mouth ulcers (30-50% of patients)
-   **Hyperlipidemia**: Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides
-   **GI upset**: Diarrhea, nausea
-   **Immunosuppression**: Increased infection risk (though less than with transplant dosing)
-   **Delayed wound healing**: Important consideration if surgery planned

Most side effects are manageable with supportive care or dose adjustments. [Source: MalaCards
Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Neoplasm]

### Duration of Therapy

Optimal treatment duration remains debated:

-   **Short-term (6-12 months)**: May suffice for KHE/KMP once coagulopathy resolved
-   **Long-term (1-2 years or more)**: Often needed for complex LMs and extensive lesions
-   **Maintenance therapy**: Some patients require low-dose maintenance to prevent rebound growth

Rebound growth after sirolimus discontinuation is common, necessitating careful monitoring and
potential re-initiation.

## 7. Emerging Therapies: Alpelisib for PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS)

While sirolimus inhibits mTOR downstream of PI3K, **alpelisib**—a selective PI3Kα inhibitor—directly
targets the mutated PIK3CA protein. Alpelisib received FDA approval in 2022 for PROS disorders,
including certain vascular malformations with PIK3CA mutations.

This represents the next generation of precision medicine: matching specific inhibitors to
identified genetic mutations rather than broadly suppressing mTOR. However, sirolimus remains
important for:

-   Lesions without identified PIK3CA mutations
-   Broader access (alpelisib is expensive and requires genetic confirmation)
-   Established safety profile in pediatric populations

## 8. Paradigm Shift in Vascular Anomaly Care

The introduction of sirolimus transformed vascular anomaly management:

### Before Sirolimus:

-   **Limited options**: Surgery, sclerotherapy, observation
-   **High morbidity**: Disfiguring procedures, incomplete resections, recurrences
-   **Life-threatening complications**: KMP mortality, uncontrolled bleeding
-   **Poor quality of life**: Chronic pain, functional impairment, cosmetic disfigurement

### After Sirolimus:

-   **Medical therapy for complex lesions**: Non-invasive first-line treatment
-   **Improved survival**: Dramatic reduction in KMP mortality
-   **Preserved function and cosmesis**: Avoidance of extensive surgery
-   **Personalized approach**: Genetic testing guides targeted therapy
