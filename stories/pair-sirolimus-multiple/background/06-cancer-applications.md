# Cancer Applications: PEComa, RCC, NETs, and Beyond

Rapamycin's discovery began with its antifungal and anticancer properties. While its
immunosuppressive effects dominated early clinical development, the cancer story eventually came
full circle—with mTOR inhibitors becoming FDA-approved cancer therapies for specific malignancies
where mTOR pathway dysregulation drives tumor growth.

## 1. Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Tumors (PEComa)

### What are PEComas?

PEComas are a rare family of mesenchymal tumors characterized by:

-   **Distinctive cell type**: Perivascular epithelioid cells with both smooth muscle and
    melanocytic features
-   **Immunohistochemistry**: Co-expression of smooth muscle markers (SMA, desmin) and melanocytic
    markers (HMB-45, Melan-A)
-   **Anatomic distribution**: Can occur anywhere but favor uterus, retroperitoneum, abdomen, and
    pelvis
-   **Clinical behavior**: Range from benign to malignant

The PEComa family includes:

-   Angiomyolipoma (AML) - typically benign, associated with TSC
-   Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) - lung-specific
-   Clear cell "sugar" tumor of lung
-   Malignant PEComa (rare, aggressive)

### Genetic Basis: TSC/mTOR Pathway Mutations

Most PEComas harbor genetic alterations activating the mTOR pathway:

-   **TSC1 or TSC2 loss**: Most common, leading to constitutive mTORC1 activation
-   **TFE3 gene fusions**: Alternative mechanism seen in some PEComas
-   **PIK3CA, AKT, or MTOR mutations**: Less common but also activating

This makes PEComas exquisitely sensitive to mTOR inhibition—the tumor's "addiction" to mTOR
signaling becomes its therapeutic vulnerability. [Source: PMC12643498]

### Historical Treatment Challenges

Malignant PEComas are aggressive with poor prognosis:

-   **Localized disease**: Complete surgical resection is curative, but lesions often unresectable
-   **Metastatic disease**: Median survival ~24 months with chemotherapy
-   **Chemotherapy resistance**: Standard sarcoma regimens (doxorubicin, ifosfamide) show limited
    efficacy
-   **No targeted therapies**: Until mTOR inhibitors, no treatments addressed underlying biology

### First-Generation mTOR Inhibitors: Modest Activity

Early trials with first-generation rapalogs (sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus) in PEComa showed:

-   **Modest responses**: Partial responses (PRs) in 10-30% of patients
-   **Disease stabilization**: Many patients achieved stable disease (SD), preventing progression
-   **Short duration**: Responses often brief (median ~4-6 months)
-   **Incomplete tumor regression**: Rare complete responses

> "Early clinical trials investigating the activity of first-generation rapalogs (rapamycin,
> everolimus, temsirolimus, etc.) showed that these drugs typically caused modest tumor regression,
> with rare partial responses (PRs), and no complete remissions for RCC or pancreatic neuroendocrine
> tumors." [Source: PMC12643498]

This modest activity was disappointing given PEComas' genetic dependence on mTOR—suggesting
incomplete target inhibition or resistance mechanisms.

### Nab-Sirolimus (ABI-009): A Breakthrough

**Nab-sirolimus** (also called FYARRO, manufactured by Aadi Bioscience) is an albumin-bound
formulation of sirolimus designed to improve drug delivery:

-   **Nanoparticle formulation**: Sirolimus bound to human serum albumin
-   **Enhanced tumor delivery**: Albumin-mediated transcytosis across endothelium
-   **Higher intratumoral concentrations**: Better tissue penetration than oral sirolimus
-   **Reduced systemic toxicity**: More targeted delivery profile

### The Phase 2 PEComa Trial (NCT02494570)

Wagner et al. conducted a pivotal phase 2 trial of nab-sirolimus in advanced PEComa patients:

**Design:**

-   **n = 34 patients** with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic PEComa
-   **Prior therapy**: 74% had received prior chemotherapy
-   **Nab-sirolimus dose**: 100 mg/m² IV weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off)
-   **Primary endpoint**: Objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1

**Results (Published 2021 in _The Lancet Oncology_):**

-   **Objective response rate**: 39% (13/34 patients with confirmed PR)
-   **Complete responses**: 2 patients (7%) achieved CR, including 1 after surgical resection of
    residual disease
-   **Median duration of response**: 40.2 months (remarkably durable)
-   **Median progression-free survival**: 10.0 months
-   **Overall survival**: Median not reached at time of publication
-   **Safety**: Manageable toxicities including mucositis, nausea, fatigue, and myelosuppression

[PMID: 34582930; Wagner AJ et al. *Lancet Oncol* 2021; 22(10):1402-1412]

These results were transformative for PEComa patients, showing:

1. **Highest response rates ever reported** in metastatic PEComa
2. **Durable responses** lasting years in some patients
3. **Tolerability** allowing prolonged therapy

### FDA Approval

Based on the phase 2 trial, in **November 2021**, the FDA granted **accelerated approval to
nab-sirolimus (FYARRO) for adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant
PEComa**.

This was a landmark:

-   **First FDA-approved therapy** specifically for PEComa
-   **Orphan drug designation** for ultra-rare malignancy
-   **Validation of mTOR inhibition** as precision therapy in genetically-defined tumors

[PMID: 34582930; FDA approval data, 2021]

### Ongoing Studies

Additional nab-sirolimus trials are investigating:

-   **Expanded access program** (NCT03817515): For PEComa and other mTOR-activated malignancies
-   **Combination with nivolumab** (NCT03190174): Phase 1/2 adding PD-1 blockade
-   **Chinese Phase Ib/II study** (NCT05625919): Evaluating safety and efficacy in Chinese
    population

## 2. Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)

### mTOR Pathway in RCC

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)—the most common kidney cancer subtype—frequently has
dysregulated mTOR signaling due to:

-   **VHL gene loss** (~80% of ccRCC): Leads to HIF stabilization and increased signaling through
    PI3K/AKT/mTOR
-   **PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway mutations**: Direct activating mutations in ~15-20%

This made mTOR inhibitors rational therapy for advanced RCC.

### Clinical Development: Everolimus and Temsirolimus

**Temsirolimus** received FDA approval in 2007 for first-line treatment of poor-risk metastatic RCC
based on a phase 3 trial showing survival benefit over interferon-alpha.

**Everolimus** received FDA approval in 2009 for metastatic RCC after failure of VEGF-targeted
therapy, based on the RECORD-1 trial:

-   **n = 416 patients** with mRCC progressing after sunitinib or sorafenib
-   **Median PFS**: 4.9 months with everolimus vs. 1.9 months with placebo (HR 0.33, p<0.001)

[Source: TargetedOnc ESMO RCC Trials]

### Current Role in RCC

Everolimus remains an important option for:

-   **Later-line therapy**: After progression on VEGF inhibitors and/or immunotherapy
-   **Combination approaches**: Being studied with VEGF inhibitors (lenvatinib + everolimus)
-   **Non-clear cell RCC**: Particularly chromophobe subtype with mTOR pathway alterations

However, the RCC treatment landscape has evolved dramatically with immunotherapy combinations (e.g.,
nivolumab + ipilimumab) now dominating first-line therapy. mTOR inhibitors remain valuable niche
treatments. [Source: TargetedOnc NCCN RCC Guidelines]

## 3. Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs)

### mTOR Dysregulation in NETs

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) frequently show mTOR pathway activation:

-   **Loss of tumor suppressors**: PTEN, TSC1/2
-   **Activation of growth factor signaling**: IGF-1, VEGF
-   **Role in hormone secretion**: mTOR regulates insulin, glucagon, gastrin production

### RADIANT Trials: Everolimus in NETs

A series of phase 3 RADIANT trials established everolimus efficacy across NET subtypes:

#### RADIANT-3: Pancreatic NETs (pNETs)

-   **n = 410 patients** with advanced pNETs
-   **Median PFS**: 11.0 months with everolimus vs. 4.6 months with placebo (HR 0.35, p<0.0001)
-   **FDA approval**: 2011 for advanced pNETs

[Source: MDPI NETs Pharmacotherapy; PMC12651392]

#### RADIANT-2: NETs with Carcinoid Syndrome

-   **n = 429 patients** with advanced NETs and carcinoid syndrome
-   **Everolimus + octreotide LAR** vs. placebo + octreotide LAR
-   **Median PFS improvement**: 5.1 months (16.4 vs. 11.3 months, HR 0.77, p=0.026)
-   Showed clinical benefit though didn't meet strict statistical significance

[Source: MDPI NETs Pharmacotherapy]

#### RADIANT-4: Non-Pancreatic GI and Lung NETs

-   **n = 302 patients** with progressive GI or lung NETs
-   **Median PFS**: 11.0 months with everolimus vs. 3.9 months with placebo
-   **FDA approval extension**: 2016 for GI and lung NETs

### Functional Benefits

Beyond tumor control, everolimus reduces hormone secretion from functional NETs:

-   **Insulin secretion**: Reduced in insulinomas
-   **Glucagon, gastrin, VIP**: Decreased in respective functional tumors
-   **Symptomatic relief**: Improved carcinoid syndrome symptoms (diarrhea, flushing)

[Source: MDPI NETs Pharmacotherapy]

### Current Clinical Use

Everolimus is standard therapy for:

-   **Advanced progressive pNETs**: First or second-line after somatostatin analogs
-   **GI and lung NETs**: After progression on somatostatin analogs
-   **Functional NETs**: For symptom control and tumor control

Ongoing studies evaluate:

-   **Lower doses (5 mg daily)**: To reduce toxicity while maintaining efficacy (EVENET trial
    NCT06472388)
-   **Combination with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT)**: Potential synergy
-   **Sequencing with other therapies**: Optimal treatment order (SEQTOR trial)

## 4. Breast Cancer

### Hormone Receptor-Positive (HR+) Breast Cancer

Everolimus received FDA approval in 2012 for HR+ advanced breast cancer based on the **BOLERO-2
trial**:

-   **n = 724 patients** with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer progressing on aromatase inhibitor
-   **Everolimus + exemestane** vs. placebo + exemestane
-   **Median PFS**: 7.8 months vs. 3.2 months (HR 0.45, p<0.0001)

### Mechanism: Overcoming Endocrine Resistance

The rationale for combining mTOR inhibitors with endocrine therapy:

-   **mTOR activation drives endocrine resistance**: Tumor cells bypass estrogen receptor dependence
    via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
-   **Everolimus restores endocrine sensitivity**: Blocking mTOR re-sensitizes cells to hormonal
    therapy

### Clinical Considerations

Everolimus + exemestane is used for:

-   **Postmenopausal women** with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer after progression on aromatase
    inhibitor
-   **Alternative to chemotherapy**: Offering targeted option with different toxicity profile

However, newer CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) have largely supplanted
everolimus in first-line settings due to superior efficacy and tolerability.

### Everolimus Resistance

Resistance to everolimus in ER+ breast cancer involves:

-   **Persistent growth factor signaling**: Activation of alternative pathways (MEK/ERK)
-   **SMARCD3 regulon activation**: Transcriptional programs bypassing mTOR dependence
-   **Combination strategies**: Adding MEK inhibitors may overcome resistance

## 5. Other Cancer Applications

### Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

-   mTOR inhibitors showed activity in early trials but NOT approved for HCC
-   Competition from more effective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, lenvatinib)

### Bladder Cancer

-   PI3K/AKT/mTOR alterations common but mTOR inhibitor monotherapy insufficient
-   Investigated in combination regimens

### Mantle Cell Lymphoma

-   Temsirolimus approved in Europe (not US) for relapsed/refractory MCL
-   Modest activity as single agent

[Source: PMC12643498]

## 6. Mechanisms of Resistance and Second-Generation Inhibitors

### Why First-Generation Rapalogs Show Modest Activity

Despite mTOR pathway addiction in many cancers, first-generation rapalogs (sirolimus, everolimus,
temsirolimus) achieve only partial tumor control due to:

#### 1. Incomplete mTOR Inhibition

-   **Rapamycin only inhibits mTORC1**, not mTORC2
-   **Selective substrate inhibition**: Blocks some but not all mTORC1 substrates (4E-BP1 poorly
    inhibited)

#### 2. Feedback Loops

-   **Relief of negative feedback**: mTOR normally suppresses PI3K/AKT; rapalogs can paradoxically
    activate AKT
-   **Compensatory pathway activation**: Increased MAPK, Wnt, or other signaling

#### 3. Acquired Resistance Mutations

-   **mTOR FRB domain mutations**: Prevent rapamycin-FKBP12 binding to mTOR
-   **mTOR kinase domain mutations**: Constitutively active despite allosteric inhibition
-   **Downstream alterations**: Activation of S6K or 4E-BP1 independent of mTOR

[Source: PMC12643498]

### Second-Generation: ATP-Competitive mTOR Inhibitors

To overcome rapalog limitations, ATP-competitive (catalytic) mTOR inhibitors were developed:

-   **Mechanism**: Directly inhibit mTOR kinase activity (both mTORC1 and mTORC2)
-   **Examples**: Sapanisertib (TAK-228), vistusertib, torkinib
-   **Advantages**: Complete mTORC1 inhibition, blocks mTORC2
-   **Disadvantages**: Greater toxicity (metabolic, GI), haven't shown superior efficacy in trials

### Third-Generation: Bi-steric mTOR Inhibitors

Newest generation combines features of rapalogs and ATP-competitive inhibitors:

-   **Mechanism**: Binds both FKBP12-rapamycin binding site AND kinase active site
-   **Example**: RMC-6272 (Revolution Medicines)
-   **Advantages**: Potent, complete mTOR inhibition; may prevent resistance mutations
-   **Status**: Early clinical development

> "Bi-steric mTOR inhibitors have shown promise in preclinical mouse models, with reduced tumor
> regrowth after treatment, in comparison with rapamycin." [Source: PMC12643498]

### The Future: Combination Strategies

Most promising approaches combine mTOR inhibitors with:

-   **Immunotherapy**: Nivolumab + nab-sirolimus (NCT03190174)
-   **Other targeted agents**: MEK inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, PARP inhibitors
-   **Chemotherapy**: Exploiting synthetic lethality
-   **Metabolic modulators**: Targeting cancer cell metabolism alongside mTOR
