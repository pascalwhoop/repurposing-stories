ELENA [urgent]:It's 2010. You're 24 years old, a medical student at the University of Pennsylvania. And you've just been told you have a disease you've never heard of, with no FDA-approved treatment, and maybe a few years to live.

MARCUS [thoughtful]:So what do you do?

ELENA [passionate]:If you're David Fajgenbaum, you teach yourself genomics. While you're undergoing chemotherapy.

MARCUS [excited]:And then you decode your own disease. You identify the exact molecular pathway that's killing you. And you realize there's already a drug that might work—a 50-year-old immunosuppressant discovered in soil from Easter Island.

ELENA [warm]:That's the story we're telling today. But it's not just David's story. It's the story of one remarkable molecule that connects brain tumors in children, lung disease in women, vascular anomalies, cancer, aging research, and now... Long COVID.

MARCUS [curious]:One drug. Multiple diseases that seem completely unrelated. How is that possible?

ELENA [reflective]:That's the question that drives this episode. Welcome to our series on drug repurposing. I'm Elena.

MARCUS: And I'm Marcus. Today, we're diving into the story of sirolimus—also known as rapamycin—a molecule that's been fighting death for 50 years.

ELENA [intrigued]:And by fighting death, you mean literally. This drug almost disappeared multiple times. It was nearly abandoned by pharmaceutical companies. But it survived.

MARCUS [passionate]:Because one scientist believed in it. Because researchers kept following the molecular thread. And because patients—like David Fajgenbaum—became their own scientists.

ELENA [hopeful]:This is a story about precision medicine realized. About understanding not just what works, but why it works. And about what happens when you follow the biology wherever it leads.

MARCUS: So let's start at the beginning. On a remote Pacific island. With a soil sample. And a scientist who refused to give up.

[pause]

ELENA [curious]: Marcus, before we dive in, I need you to answer something. How can one drug work for brain tumors, lung disease, and aging? That seems impossible.

MARCUS [intrigued]: That's the mystery we're going to solve together. The answer lies in understanding what this molecule actually does inside cells. And that story begins in the most unlikely place.

ELENA [thoughtful]: Easter Island.

MARCUS [excited]: Easter Island.
