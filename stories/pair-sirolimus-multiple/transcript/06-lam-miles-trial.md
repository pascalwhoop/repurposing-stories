ELENA [curious] So we've just seen how sirolimus transformed care for tuberous sclerosis complex. Now let's talk about LAM—lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Marcus, what is this disease?

MARCUS [thoughtful] LAM is a rare, progressive lung disease that almost exclusively affects women of reproductive age—typically in their 30s to 50s. It's characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells in the lungs. These cells form cysts that destroy normal lung tissue.

ELENA [concerned] So their lungs are essentially being replaced by cysts?

MARCUS [urgent] Yes. And as the disease progresses, lung function declines. Patients become short of breath, first with exertion, then at rest. They need supplemental oxygen. And before the MILES trial, there was no disease-modifying therapy. The trajectory was inevitable—lung transplant or death.

ELENA [reflective] That's terrifying. Watching your ability to breathe slowly disappear.

MARCUS [passionate] It is. And what makes LAM even more poignant is that it primarily affects young women—mothers, professionals, people in the prime of their lives. They're told, 'Your lungs will get worse. We can't stop it. We can only manage symptoms.'

ELENA [curious] But there's a connection to TSC, right? To the same mTOR pathway?

MARCUS [excited] Yes! That's the key insight. About one-third of LAM cases occur in women with tuberous sclerosis complex—they have TSC1 or TSC2 mutations. But the other two-thirds are sporadic LAM, where the mutations arise in the lung cells themselves, not in the germline.

ELENA [intrigued] So even in sporadic LAM, you still have TSC1 or TSC2 dysfunction?

MARCUS [thoughtful] Exactly. The lung cells acquire mutations that inactivate TSC1 or TSC2. The result is the same—mTOR hyperactivation, uncontrolled cell growth, cyst formation. Different origin, same pathway.

ELENA [hopeful] Which means sirolimus might work.

MARCUS [passionate] That was the hypothesis. And Francis Xavier McCormack at the University of Cincinnati led the pivotal trial to test it—the MILES trial. Multicentric International LAM Efficacy of Sirolimus.

ELENA [curious] Walk me through the design.

MARCUS [excited] 116 patients with LAM. Randomized to sirolimus or placebo. The primary endpoint was lung function decline—measured as the change in FEV1, forced expiratory volume in one second, over 12 months. This is the gold standard for measuring lung function in progressive diseases.

ELENA [thoughtful] So they weren't measuring whether tumors shrank, like in the TSC trials. They were measuring whether lung function decline could be slowed?

MARCUS [warm] Exactly. Because in LAM, the cysts are diffuse throughout the lungs. You can't remove them surgically. The goal isn't to make them disappear—it's to stop new ones from forming and preserve whatever lung function remains.

ELENA [hopeful] And the results?

MARCUS [passionate] Striking. In the placebo group, lung function declined at the expected rate—about 12 milliliters per month. But in the sirolimus group, lung function stabilized. The decline was essentially halted.

ELENA [excited] Wait—stabilized? They didn't lose ground?

MARCUS [reverential] They didn't lose ground. And when the trial was extended to three years, the benefit persisted. Patients on sirolimus maintained their lung function. They could breathe easier. They could walk farther. They could keep working, keep living.

ELENA [reflective] That's not a cure, but it's transformative.

MARCUS [warm] It is. One LAM patient described it this way: 'After MILES, I stopped losing ground. That changed everything.' She wasn't getting her old lungs back, but she wasn't spiraling toward transplant anymore either.

ELENA [curious] When was this published?

MARCUS [thoughtful] The MILES trial was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2011. And in 2015, the FDA approved sirolimus for LAM—the first disease-modifying therapy ever approved for this condition.

ELENA [hopeful] So for the first time, pulmonologists had something to offer LAM patients beyond surveillance and symptom management?

MARCUS [passionate] Exactly. And it wasn't just the drug—it was the framework. Understanding that LAM is driven by mTOR hyperactivation transformed the disease from a mysterious lung condition to a mechanistic target. Researchers could now think rationally about other interventions.

ELENA [intrigued] Like what?

MARCUS [excited] Like inhaled sirolimus. One of the challenges with oral sirolimus is systemic toxicity—mouth sores, elevated cholesterol, impaired wound healing. But if you could deliver sirolimus directly to the lungs, you might preserve the benefit while reducing side effects.

ELENA [curious] Is that being tested?

MARCUS [thoughtful] Yes. Multiple groups are developing inhaled formulations of sirolimus for LAM and other pulmonary diseases—pulmonary arterial hypertension, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after lung transplant. The idea is to target the pathway locally, where you need it most.

ELENA [hopeful] So the LAM story isn't finished?

MARCUS [warm] Not at all. LAM is now a model for how understanding mechanism enables not just drug repurposing, but rational drug development. And it's also a model for patient advocacy—the LAM Foundation played a crucial role in funding research and supporting the MILES trial.

ELENA [reflective] That's a theme we keep seeing—patients and families driving the science.

MARCUS [reverential] It is. And nowhere is that more evident than in our next chapter, which is about pediatric vascular anomalies. Because in that domain, it was observant clinicians who recognized sirolimus's potential and started using it off-label, even without formal FDA approval.

ELENA [curious] Off-label use becoming standard-of-care?

MARCUS [passionate] Exactly. And it's saving children's lives. Let's talk about that now.
