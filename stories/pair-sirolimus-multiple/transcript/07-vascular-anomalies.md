ELENA [thoughtful] So far we've talked about tuberous sclerosis complex and LAM—both rare diseases where mTOR dysregulation was well-established. But now I want to talk about something different. A story where clinicians didn't wait for formal trials—they just started using sirolimus because they saw it working.

MARCUS [intrigued] Vascular anomalies.

ELENA [curious] Tell me what we're dealing with here. What are vascular anomalies?

MARCUS [thoughtful] Vascular anomalies are a diverse group of conditions involving abnormal blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. They range from simple birthmarks—hemangiomas that resolve on their own—to complex, life-threatening lesions. The one we're focusing on is kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, or KHE.

ELENA [concerned] And that's serious?

MARCUS [urgent] Very serious. KHE typically presents in infancy or early childhood. It's a tumor-like mass of abnormal endothelial cells—the cells that line blood vessels. And in about 70% of cases, it causes something called Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon.

ELENA [curious] What's that?

MARCUS [passionate] The tumor traps and consumes platelets—the blood cells responsible for clotting. Platelet counts plummet. And without enough platelets, patients are at risk of life-threatening bleeding. Spontaneous hemorrhages. It's an emergency.

ELENA [reflective] So you have a child with a growing vascular lesion that's consuming their platelets. What was the treatment before sirolimus?

MARCUS [concerned] Limited options. Steroids, which sometimes work but often don't. Chemotherapy agents like vincristine. Surgical resection, but that's risky if the lesion is in a critical location—near the face, the airway, or major blood vessels. And even with treatment, outcomes were unpredictable.

ELENA [hopeful] So how did sirolimus enter the picture?

MARCUS [excited] Through astute clinical observation. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, pediatric hematology-oncologists started noticing that mTOR plays a role in endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis—the formation of new blood vessels. And they knew sirolimus inhibits mTOR.

ELENA [curious] So they thought, 'If vascular anomalies involve endothelial overgrowth, maybe sirolimus could help'?

MARCUS [passionate] Exactly. They started using sirolimus off-label for KHE and other complex vascular anomalies. And the responses were dramatic. Children who'd failed multiple therapies suddenly improved. Platelet counts normalized. Lesions stabilized or shrank.

ELENA [intrigued] How quickly did this spread?

MARCUS [warm] Faster than you'd expect. Case reports started appearing in the literature. One center would publish their experience—five patients, eight patients—showing 70, 80, even 90% response rates. Other centers would read those reports and think, 'We need to try this.'

ELENA [reflective] That's real-world evidence driving practice.

MARCUS [thoughtful] It is. And it's a fascinating example of how drug repurposing doesn't always follow the traditional path—large randomized trials followed by FDA approval. Sometimes, when the need is urgent and the evidence is compelling, off-label use becomes standard-of-care.

ELENA [curious] But is that safe? Using a drug off-label in children?

MARCUS [concerned] It's a fair question. And pediatric oncologists didn't take this lightly. They monitored sirolimus levels carefully. They watched for side effects—infections, mouth sores, hyperlipidemia. But the risk-benefit calculation was clear: these children were facing disfigurement, hemorrhage, or death. Sirolimus offered hope.

ELENA [hopeful] And it worked?

MARCUS [passionate] It worked. A parent whose child had KHE described it this way: 'No surgery. No chemo. Just a pill. His life changed.' The lesion stabilized. The platelet count came up. The risk of bleeding disappeared.

ELENA [warm] That's powerful.

MARCUS [reflective] And the mechanism made sense. Vascular anomalies involve endothelial cell proliferation. mTOR regulates endothelial growth. Sirolimus inhibits mTOR. It's rational therapy based on understanding the biology.

ELENA [curious] Are there formal trials now?

MARCUS [thoughtful] There are. Prospective cohort studies documenting response rates. Comparing outcomes to historical controls—kids treated before sirolimus was available. And the data consistently shows high response rates, reduced need for surgery, improved quality of life.

ELENA [intrigued] What about other vascular anomalies? Does sirolimus work for those too?

MARCUS [excited] Yes! Lymphatic malformations, venous malformations, complex mixed lesions—all of these have shown responses to sirolimus. The common thread is mTOR involvement in vascular development and angiogenesis.

ELENA [hopeful] So this isn't just about KHE. It's about a whole class of vascular conditions?

MARCUS [passionate] Exactly. And it's expanding. Researchers are now looking at sirolimus for arteriovenous malformations, for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, for other rare vascular syndromes. The principle is the same: if mTOR is dysregulated, sirolimus might help.

ELENA [reflective] This story feels different from TSC and LAM. Those had large, well-designed randomized trials leading to FDA approvals. Vascular anomalies have real-world evidence and off-label use.

MARCUS [thoughtful] That's true. And it raises important questions about how we validate therapies, especially in rare pediatric diseases where large trials are challenging. Do we wait years for formal trials, or do we act on compelling real-world evidence when lives are at stake?

ELENA [curious] What do you think the answer is?

MARCUS [warm] I think it's nuanced. Formal trials are critical for establishing safety and efficacy. But when you have a rare disease, a rational mechanism, and strong observational data, sometimes you have to act. The key is rigorous monitoring, transparent reporting, and a commitment to eventually conducting prospective studies.

ELENA [hopeful] So the pediatric vascular anomaly story is ongoing?

MARCUS [passionate] It is. And it's a testament to the courage of clinicians who were willing to try something new, and the resilience of families who trusted them.

ELENA [reflective] And it's another example of mTOR dysregulation explaining a seemingly unrelated disease.

MARCUS [excited] Exactly. Brain tumors, kidney tumors, lung disease, vascular anomalies—all connected by one pathway. And all treatable with one drug. That's the power of understanding mechanism.

ELENA [intrigued] So what's next? We've covered TSC, LAM, and vascular anomalies. Are there other diseases where sirolimus is being used?

MARCUS [reverential] Oh yes. And the next chapter is the most remarkable of all. Because it's the story of a patient who didn't just benefit from sirolimus—he discovered it for himself.

ELENA [curious] David Fajgenbaum.

MARCUS [warm] David Fajgenbaum. Let's tell that story now.
