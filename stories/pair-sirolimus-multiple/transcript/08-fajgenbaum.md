ELENA: [reverential] 2010. University of Pennsylvania Medical School. A 24-year-old medical student named David Fajgenbaum is rushed to the hospital with fever, massive lymph node swelling, and organ failure. He's diagnosed with multicentric Castleman's disease—MCD.

MARCUS: [concerned] A rare lymphoproliferative disorder. Benign, but aggressive. Driven by excessive IL-6 signaling, which causes systemic inflammation, organ damage, and potential progression to lymphoma.

ELENA: [urgent] And there's no FDA-approved therapy. The prognosis? Maybe a few years.

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Most patients in Fajgenbaum's situation would focus on treatment options their doctors recommend—chemotherapy, immunosuppressants, clinical trials if available. But Fajgenbaum did something else.

ELENA: [passionate] He decided to understand his disease at the molecular level. While undergoing chemotherapy.

MARCUS: [reverential] He taught himself genomics, systems biology, pathway analysis. He dove into the scientific literature. He wasn't just a patient—he became a scientist investigating his own condition.

ELENA: [curious] What was he looking for?

MARCUS: [excited] The mechanism. The molecular pathways driving his disease. Because if he could identify those, he might find a drug that was already approved for something else—something that could be repurposed.

ELENA: [intrigued] And what did he find?

MARCUS: [passionate] He found that MCD involves dysregulation of the IL-6 pathway. IL-6 is a cytokine—a signaling molecule that drives inflammation. And excessive IL-6 activates downstream pathways, including mTOR. That connection—IL-6 to mTOR—was key.

ELENA: [thoughtful] So he recognized that mTOR was hyperactive in Castleman's disease?

MARCUS: [excited] Yes. And he knew that sirolimus inhibits mTOR. It was already FDA-approved for transplant rejection and TSC. So he hypothesized: if mTOR is driving my disease, sirolimus might work for me.

ELENA: [reflective] That's extraordinary. A patient identifying his own therapeutic target.

MARCUS: [warm] It is. But he still needed his doctors to agree. This was off-label use of a drug for a disease it had never been tested in. It required trust, courage, and a willingness to take a calculated risk.

ELENA: [curious] And they agreed?

MARCUS: [reverential] They did. On compassionate grounds. Fajgenbaum had already failed standard therapies. He was running out of options. His medical team at Penn reviewed his hypothesis, looked at the evidence, and said, 'Let's try it.'

ELENA: [hopeful] And?

MARCUS: [passionate] He went into remission.

[pause]

ELENA: [excited] Wait—remission? How long has he been in remission?

MARCUS: [warm] More than a decade. Fajgenbaum started sirolimus in 2013 or 2014. He's been in sustained remission ever since.

ELENA: [reverential] That's not just a medical success. That's a triumph of patient agency.

MARCUS: [passionate] It absolutely is. And Fajgenbaum didn't stop there. He founded the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network—CDCN—a patient-driven research organization dedicated to understanding MCD and finding treatments for others.

ELENA: [curious] So he turned his personal experience into a mission to help other patients?

MARCUS: [thoughtful] Exactly. CDCN maintains a patient registry, funds research, facilitates clinical trials. And sirolimus is now being tested in prospective MCD trials based on Fajgenbaum's initial success.

ELENA: [reflective] This is such a powerful story. But I want to understand the science. You said MCD involves IL-6 and mTOR. How are they connected?

MARCUS: [excited] IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. When it's overproduced—as in MCD—it activates multiple downstream pathways. One of those is mTOR.

ELENA: [curious] So excessive IL-6 feeds into mTOR hyperactivation?

MARCUS: [passionate] Exactly. Which drives cell proliferation, inflammation, and organ damage. By inhibiting mTOR with sirolimus, Fajgenbaum was blocking one of IL-6's key downstream effects. And for him, it worked.

ELENA: [thoughtful] Does that mean sirolimus could work for other IL-6-driven diseases?

MARCUS: [intrigued] That's a fascinating question. And researchers are exploring it. IL-6 dysregulation appears in autoimmune diseases like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and even in some severe COVID cases. If mTOR is part of the IL-6 signaling cascade in those conditions, sirolimus might have broader applications.

ELENA: [hopeful] So Fajgenbaum's discovery might extend beyond Castleman's disease?

MARCUS: [excited] It might. And that's the power of mechanistic thinking. You identify a pathway—IL-6/mTOR—in one disease, and then you ask: where else does this pathway matter?

ELENA: [reflective] This story feels like the emotional heart of the episode. Because it's not just about a drug or a disease. It's about what happens when a patient refuses to accept a death sentence and becomes their own advocate.

MARCUS: [reverential] It is. Fajgenbaum represents something profound—the democratization of medical knowledge. He had access to scientific literature. He had the intelligence to understand it. And he had the courage to act on that understanding.

ELENA: [thoughtful] But not every patient has those resources or that background. Fajgenbaum was a medical student. What does his story mean for patients who don't have that training?

MARCUS: [passionate] That's a critical point. Fajgenbaum's story is inspiring, but it also highlights inequities. Not everyone can teach themselves genomics. Not everyone has access to compassionate use protocols or supportive physicians. So while we celebrate Fajgenbaum's success, we also need to build systems that give all patients access to cutting-edge science.

ELENA: [hopeful] That's what CDCN is trying to do, right? Create networks, share knowledge, facilitate trials?

MARCUS: [warm] Exactly. And that's the legacy Fajgenbaum is building. Not just his personal survival, but a framework for patient-driven research that can help others.

ELENA: [curious] So what's the broader lesson here? What does Fajgenbaum's story teach us about drug repurposing?

MARCUS: [passionate] It teaches us that patients can be scientists. That understanding mechanism empowers action. That desperation plus intelligence plus access to knowledge can unlock breakthroughs. And that the best medical science happens when patients, clinicians, and researchers collaborate.

ELENA: [reflective] One man's refusal to accept his fate changed the trajectory of research for an entire disease.

MARCUS: [warm] It did. And it's a reminder that drug repurposing isn't just a pharmaceutical strategy—it's a human story. About hope, ingenuity, and the power of asking 'why.'

ELENA: [hopeful] So where does the sirolimus story go from here? We've covered TSC, LAM, vascular anomalies, Castleman's disease. Are there more frontiers?

MARCUS: [excited] Oh yes. Aging. Autoimmunity. Long COVID. The mTOR pathway is involved in all of them. And researchers are now testing sirolimus in contexts that would have seemed unimaginable 20 years ago.

ELENA: [intrigued] Let's talk about those emerging applications.
